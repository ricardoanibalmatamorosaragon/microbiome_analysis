Cells of strain J115<sup>T</sup> were straight rods, generally 1.8-3.0\u2009\u00b5m, but could be up to 18\u2009\u00b5m long. Growth occurred below 2\u200a% (w/v) NaCl and 2\u200a% (v/v) bile. Strain J115<sup>T</sup> produced acid from myo-inositol but not from d-glucose, d-ribose or d-xylose. Butyric acid was the major end-product from myo-inositol. The genomic DNA G+C\u2009content was 58.92\u2009mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that the closest cultivated neighbours of strain J115<sup>T</sup> were Oscillibacterruminantium GH1<sup>T</sup> (95.4\u200a% similarity) and Oscillibactervalericigenes Sjm18-20<sup>T</sup> (94.1\u200a%). Strain J115<sup>T</sup> was also related to the not-yet-cultured bacterium Oscillospiraguilliermondii (92-93\u200a%\u2009similarity). Coherently with the 16S rRNA gene sequence results, the average nucleotide identity scores of strain J115<sup>T</sup> to O. ruminantium GH1<sup>T</sup> and O. valericigenes Sjm18-20<sup>T</sup> were 73.37 and 73.24, respectively, while in silico estimations of DNA-DNA hybridization were both 20.4 %, with confidence intervals of 18.2 - 22.9 % and 18.2 - 22.8 %, respectively. The major fatty acids were iso-C15\u200a:\u200a0 (24.2\u200a%), C18\u200a:\u200a0 DMA (18.4\u200a%), anteiso-C15\u200a:\u200a0 (15.2\u200a%) and C16\u200a:\u200a0 DMA (7.6\u200a%). No respiratory quinone was detected. Based on phenotypic features and phylogenetic position, it is proposed that this isolate represents a novel species in a new genus, Dysosmobacterwelbionis gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Dysosmobacterwelbionis is J115<sup>T</sup> (DSM 106889<sup>T</sup> = LMG 30601<sup>T</sup>)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1\u200bUCLouvain, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, WELBIO - Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Louvain Drug Research Institute (LDRI), Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group, Brussels, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Le Roy", "ForeName": "Tiphaine", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2\u200bUCLouvain, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, de Duve Institute, Brussels, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van der Smissen", "ForeName": "Patrick", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3\u200bUCLouvain, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain Drug Research Institute (LDRI), Bioanalysis and Pharmacology of Bioactive Lipids Research Group (BPBL), Brussels, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paquot", "ForeName": "Adrien", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1\u200bUCLouvain, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, WELBIO - Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Louvain Drug Research Institute (LDRI), Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group, Brussels, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Delzenne", "ForeName": "Nathalie", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3\u200bUCLouvain, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain Drug Research Institute (LDRI), Bioanalysis and Pharmacology of Bioactive Lipids Research Group (BPBL), Brussels, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Muccioli", "ForeName": "Giulio G", "Initials": "GG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4\u200bUCLouvain, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, WELBIO - Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology, de Duve Institute, Brussels Center for Redox Biology, Brussels, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Collet", "ForeName": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1\u200bUCLouvain, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, WELBIO - Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Louvain Drug Research Institute (LDRI), Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group, Brussels, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cani", "ForeName": "Patrice D", "Initials": "PD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Syst Evol Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100899600", "ISSNLinking": "1466-5026"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["31232680", "10.1099/ijsem.0.003547"]}}]}]
