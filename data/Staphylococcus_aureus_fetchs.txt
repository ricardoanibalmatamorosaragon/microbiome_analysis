Additionally, poor solid state characterization of the polymorphs and diversity in the existing nomenclature impede the correct identification of the raw materials. In this work, oxytetracycline hydrochloride solid forms were prepared from isopropyl alcohol, ethanol and methanol through different crystallization techniques, and then their physicochemical and microbiological properties were evaluated. A combination of advanced techniques such as solid state nuclear magnetic resonance, powder X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermal analysis, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used in the characterization of solid samples giving clear evidence of the existence of three stable and one metastable solid forms of the oxytetracycline hydrochloride. Solubility was determined in aqueous solution, simulated gastric fluid, and simulated intestinal fluid. In addition, microbiological studies were performed. The polymorphs showed similar antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore, these solid forms of oxytetracycline hydrochloride constitute promising candidates to encourage studies for repositioning old and known antibiotic drugs in the developing strategies for new therapeutic alternatives."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.

This method is based on the use of Klenow fragment (KF)-assisted target recycling amplification and hybridization chain reaction (HCR). A triple complex was designed that contained a capture probe (CP), a trigger probe (TP), and a help probe (HP), which were partially complementary to one another. In the absence of the target, all the oligonucleotides labeled with carboxyfluorescein (FAM) are adsorbed onto the surface of GO by \u03c0-stacking interactions. This adsorption quenches the FAM signal. On the contrary, the target RNA causes the triple complex to disintegrate and initiates strand-displacement polymerization reaction (SDPR) and HCR in the presence of the appropriate raw materials, including the primer, KF, dNTPs, hairpin 1 (H1), and hairpin 2 (H2), generating double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) products. These dsDNA products are repelled by GO and produce strong fluorescence, measured at excitation/emission wavelengths of 480/514\u00a0nm. The fluorescent signal is greatly amplified by SYBR Green I (SGI) due to the synergistic effect of dsDNA-SGI. The target was assayed with this method at concentrations in the range 10 fM to 100 pM, and the detection limit (LOD) was 10 fM. This method also displayed good applicability in the analysis of real samples. It provides a new way of monitoring biofilm formation and studying the mechanisms of drug actions.

A structural hallmark is its <i>N,N'</i>-diaryl urea motif which is also present in other antibiotics including the recently reported small molecule PK150. We here show that, like PK150, TCC exhibits an inhibitory effect on <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> menaquinone metabolism via inhibition of the biosynthesis protein MenG. However, the activity spectrum (MIC<sub>90</sub>) of TCC across a broad range of multi-drug resistant staphylococci and enterococci strains was much narrower compared to PK150. Accordingly, TCC did not cause an over-activation of signal peptidase SpsB, a hallmark of the PK150 mode of action. Furthermore, we were able to rule out inhibition of FabI, a confirmed target of the diaryl ether antibiotic triclosan (TCS). Differences in the target profile of TCC and TCS were further investigated by proteomic analysis, showing complex, but rather distinct changes in the protein expression profile of <i>S. aureus</i> Downregulation of the arginine deiminase pathway provided additional evidence for an effect on bacterial energy metabolism by TCC.<b>Importance</b> TCC's widespread use as an antimicrobial agent has made it a ubiquitous environmental pollutant despite its withdrawal due to ecological and toxicological concerns. With its antibacterial mechanism of action still being unknown, we undertook a comparative target analysis between TCC, PK150, a recently discovered antibacterial compound with structural reminiscence to TCC, and TCS, another widely employed chlorinated biphenyl antimicrobial, in the bacterium <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> We show that there are distinct differences in each compound's mode of action, but also identify a shared target between TCC and PK150, which is interference with menaquinone metabolism by inhibition of MenG. The prevailing differences, however, which also manifest in a remarkably better broad spectrum activity of PK150, suggest that even high levels of TCC or TCS resistance observed by continuous environmental exposure may not affect the potential of PK150 or related <i>N,N'</i>-diaryl urea compounds as new antibiotic drug candidates against multi-drug resistant infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 American Society for Microbiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair of Organic Chemistry II, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Garching bei M\u00fcnchen, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Macsics", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair of Organic Chemistry II, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Garching bei M\u00fcnchen, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hackl", "ForeName": "Mathias W", "Initials": "MW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair of Organic Chemistry II, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Garching bei M\u00fcnchen, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fetzer", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair of Organic Chemistry II, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Garching bei M\u00fcnchen, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mostert", "ForeName": "Dietrich", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Reference Centre for Staphylococci and Enterococci, Robert Koch Institute, Wernigerode, Germany."}], "Identifier": ["https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5167-3836"], "LastName": "Bender", "ForeName": "Jennifer", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Reference Centre for Staphylococci and Enterococci, Robert Koch Institute, Wernigerode, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Layer", "ForeName": "Franziska", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair of Organic Chemistry II, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Garching bei M\u00fcnchen, Germany. stephan.sieber@tum.de."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Helmholtz Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sieber", "ForeName": "Stephan A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Environ Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7605801", "ISSNLinking": "0099-2240"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["32503913", "AEM.00933-20", "10.1128/AEM.00933-20"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [], "PMID": "32503672", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "06", "Day": "06"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "06", "Day": "05"}], "ELocationID": ["10.1186/s40168-020-00866-1"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "2049-2618", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "8", "Issue": "1", "PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "Jun", "Day": "05"}}, "Title": "Microbiome", "ISOAbbreviation": "Microbiome"}, "ArticleTitle": "Skin microbiota analysis-inspired development of novel anti-infectives.", "Pagination": {"MedlinePgn": "85"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["The alarming spread of antimicrobial resistance requires the development of novel anti-infective drugs.

The bacterial dihydrofolate reductase enzyme is effectively inhibited by trimethoprim, a compound with antibacterial activity. Previously, we reported a trimethoprim derivative containing an acryloyl linker and a dihydophthalazine moiety demonstrating increased potency against S.\u00a0aureus. We have expanded this series and assessed in\u00a0vitro enzyme inhibition (K<sub>i</sub>) and whole cell growth inhibition properties (MIC). Modifications were focused at a chiral carbon within the phthalazine heterocycle, as well as simultaneous modification at positions on the dihydrophthalazine. MIC values increased from 0.0626-0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL into the 0.5-1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL range when the edge positions were modified with either methyl or methoxy groups. Changes at the chiral carbon affected K<sub>i</sub> measurements but with little impact on MIC values. Our structural data revealed accommodation of predominantly the S-enantiomer of the inhibitors within the folate-binding pocket. Longer modifications at the chiral carbon, such as p-methylbenzyl, protrude from the pocket into solvent and result in poorer K<sub>i</sub> values, as do modifications with greater torsional freedom, such as 1-ethylpropyl. The most efficacious K<sub>i</sub> was 0.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0nM, obtained with a cyclopropyl derivative containing dimethoxy modifications at the dihydrophthalazine edge. The co-crystal structure revealed an alternative placement of the phthalazine moiety into a shallow surface at the edge of the site that can accommodate either enantiomer of the inhibitor. The current design, therefore, highlights how to engineer specific placement of the inhibitor within this alternative pocket, which in turn maximizes the enzyme inhibitory properties of racemic mixtures."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Since they play crucial roles for efficient viral DNA replication in herpesviruses, they have been considered as potential antiviral targets. In our previous work, Staphylococcus aureus SAUGI was identified as a DNA mimic protein that targets UDGs from S. aureus, human, Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Interestingly, SAUGI has the strongest inhibitory effects with EBVUDG. Here, we determined complex structures of SAUGI with EBVUDG and another \u03b3-herpesvirus UDG from Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHVUDG), which SAUGI fails to effectively inhibit. Structural analysis of the SAUGI/EBVUDG complex suggests that the additional interaction between SAUGI and the leucine loop may explain why SAUGI shows the highest binding capacity with EBVUDG. In contrast, SAUGI appears to make only partial contacts with the key components responsible for the compression and stabilization of the DNA backbone in the leucine loop extension of KSHVUDG. The findings in this study provide a molecular explanation for the differential inhibitory effects and binding strengths that SAUGI has on these two UDGs, and the structural basis of the differences should be helpful in developing inhibitors that would interfere with viral DNA replication."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.

If CPS counts exceed 105 CFU/mL, enterotoxin tests must be conducted. In the case the enterotoxin test shows positive results the cheese must be destroyed. Manufacturers of Swiss Alpine cheese are exempt from this legislation because enterotoxin formation in hard cheese is expected to be very unlikely, given the high scalding temperatures the cheese is exposed to during its production. Such temperatures result in inactivation of CPS in the curd. However, this assumption has not yet been scientifically demonstrated. Therefore, a laboratory-scale cheese production experiment was performed, in which the conditions corresponded with certain limitations to practical cheese-making conditions in terms of temperature and time exposure like in Gruyere or Tete de Moine Swiss type cheese. Raw milk aliquots (200 ml) were inoculated with five different strains of CPS, and scalding temperatures, ranging from 46-56\u00b0 C, were applied during cheese production. The temperatures applied after pressing the curd aimed at reproducing the temperature curve in the peripheral zone of a real cheese wheel. Contrary to expectations, enterotoxin formation occurred and changed with the different scalding temperatures (52-56\u00b0 C).The differences in enterotoxin formation were more associated with strain type rather than temperature.

Such alternative water sources, the discharge of untreated or poorly treated sewage into water bodies also has adverse consequences to human and environmental health. Although chemicals like chlorine have proven effective in preventing the spread of waterborne microbial pathogens, some of these may produce by-products that are toxic to humans, animals and the environment. Thus, in the current study, Cubic Ni0.6Zn0.4Fe2O4 and Ni0.6Zn0.2Ce0.2Fe2O4 spinal magnetic nano-cubes structures were prepared by a citrate, eco-friendly sol-gel process and used to treat sewage collected from one of the main drains of the Nile River in Egypt. The synthesized MNPs had an excellent antimicrobial effect against bacterial and fungal species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger. The MNPs also demonstrated a remarkable ability to eliminate pathogenic bacteria in the sewage samples.

important health problems and global action plans have been proposed globally. Prevention plays a key role in these actions plan and, in this context, we propose the use of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Time Series Forecasting techniques, for predicting future outbreaks of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Infection incidence forecasting is approached as a Feature Selection based Time Series Forecasting problem using multivariate time series composed of incidence of Staphylococcus aureus Methicillin-sensible and MRSA infections, influenza incidence and total days of therapy of both of Levofloxacin and Oseltamivir antimicrobials. Data were collected from the University Hospital of Getafe (Spain) from January 2009 to January 2018, using months as time granularity. The main contributions of the work are the following: the applications of wrapper feature selection methods where the search strategy is based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) along with evaluators based on the most powerful state-of-the-art regression algorithms. The performance of the feature selection methods has been measured using the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) performance metrics. A novel multi-criteria decision-making process is proposed in order to select the most satisfactory forecasting model, using the metrics previously mentioned, as well as the slopes of model prediction lines in the 1, 2 and 3 steps-ahead predictions. The multi-criteria decision-making process is applied to the best models resulting from a ranking of databases and regression algorithms obtained through multiple statistical tests. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a feature selection based multivariate time series methodology is proposed for antibiotic resistance forecasting. Final results show that the best model according to the proposed multi-criteria decision making process provides a RMSE\u202f= (0.1349, 0.1304, 0.1325) and a MAE\u202f=\u202f(0.1003, 0.096, 0.0987) for 1, 2, and 3 steps-ahead predictions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE)-based polymer has recently generated a huge market in the healthcare industry. TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO are well known for their instant photocatalytic killing of hospital-acquired infections, especially multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. This study investigated the actions of LLDPE/TiO<sub>2</sub>/ZnO (1:3) nanocomposites in different weight% against two representative MDR pathogens, namely, methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) and <i>Klebsiella pneumonia</i> (<i>K.pneumoniae</i>). Antibacterial activities were quantified according to international standard guidelines of CLSI MO2-A11 (static condition) and ASTM E-2149 (dynamic condition). Preliminary observation via a scanning electron microscope revealed that LLDPE matrix with TiO<sub>2</sub>/ZnO nanocomposites changed the bacterial morphology and reduced the bacterial adherence and biofilm formation. Furthermore, a high ZnO weight ratio killed both types of pathogens. The bactericidal potential of the nanocomposite is highlighted by the enhancements in photocatalytic activity, zinc ion release and reactive species, and bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity against bacterial growth.

This study aimed to profile gene expression of MRSA treated with CAP and cyclo-(L-Val-L-Pro) compounds using DNA microarray. Treatment of MRSA with CAP resulted in upregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis, suggesting the coping mechanism of MRSA due to the inhibition of protein synthesis effect from CAP. Most upregulated genes in cyclo-(L-Val-L-Pro) were putative genes with unknown functions. Interestingly, genes encoding ribosomal proteins, cell membrane synthesis, DNA metabolism, citric acid cycle and virulence were downregulated in MRSA treated with cyclo-(L-Val-L-Pro) compound, suggesting the efficacy of this compound in targeting multiple biological pathways.

In present study, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized using leaf extracts of two medicinal plants Cassia fistula and Melia azadarach. 0.01\u2009M zinc acetate dihydrate was used as a precursor in leaf extracts of respective plants for NPs synthesis. The structural and optical properties of NPs were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV-Vis) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The antibacterial potential of ZnO NPs was examined by paper disc diffusion method against two clinical strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) based on the zone of inhibition and minimal inhibitory indices (MIC). Change in color of the reaction mixture from brown to white indicated the formation of ZnO NPs. UV peaks at 320\u2009nm and 324\u2009nm, and XRD pattern matching that of JCPDS card for ZnO confirmed the presence of pure ZnO NPs. FTIR further confirmed the presence of bioactive functional groups involved in the reduction of bulk zinc acetate to ZnO NPs. SEM analysis displayed the shape of NPs to be spherical whereas DLS showed their size range from 3 to 68\u2009nm. The C. fistula and M. azadarach mediated ZnO NPs showed strong antimicrobial activity against clinical pathogens compared to standard drugs, suggesting that plant based synthesis of NPs can be an excellent strategy to develop versatile and eco-friendly biomedical products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, International Islamic University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Naseer", "ForeName": "Minha", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, University of Agriculture Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan. usmanaslam@uaf.edu.pk."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8145-8360"], "LastName": "Aslam", "ForeName": "Usman", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 11A Datun Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100101, P.R.

In this study, we investigated an innovative, drug-free, dual-wavelength irradiation approach that combines 2 wavelengths of light, 460 nm and 405 nm, against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MRSA was initially irradiated with 460-nm light (90-360 J/cm2) and subsequently irradiated with aliquots of 405-nm light (54-324 J/cm2). For in vivo studies, mouse skin was abraded and infected with approximately 107 CFUs of MRSA and incubated for 3 hours before irradiating with 460 nm (360 J/cm2) and 405 nm (342 J/cm2). Naive mouse skin was also irradiated to investigate apoptosis. We found that staphyloxanthin, the carotenoid pigment in MRSA cells, promoted resistance to the antimicrobial effects of 405-nm light. In addition, we found that the photolytic effect of 460-nm light on staphyloxanthin attenuated resistance of MRSA to 405-nm light killing. Irradiation of 460 nm alone did not elicit any antimicrobial effect on MRSA. In a proof-of-principle mouse skin abrasion infection model, we observed significant killing of MRSA using the dual-wavelength irradiation approach. However, when either wavelength of light was administered alone, no significant decrease in bacterial viability was observed. Moreover, exposure of the dual-wavelength irradiation to naive mouse skin did not result in any visible apoptosis. In conclusion, a dual-wavelength irradiation strategy may offer an innovative, effective, and safe approach for the treatment of skin infections caused by MRSA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wellman Center for Photomedicine."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, and."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leanse", "ForeName": "Leon G", "Initials": "LG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wellman Center for Photomedicine."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, and."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goh", "ForeName": "Xueping Sharon", "Initials": "XS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Ji-Xin", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hooper", "ForeName": "David C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wellman Center for Photomedicine."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, and."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Tianhong", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "JCI Insight", "NlmUniqueID": "101676073", "ISSNLinking": "2379-3708"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "04", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32493838", "134343", "10.1172/jci.insight.134343"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [["antibiotics", "clinical trials", "community-acquired pneumonia", "infectious diseases", "pleuromutilin"]], "PMID": "32493034", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "06", "Day": "04"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "06", "Day": "04"}], "ELocationID": ["10.1177/1060028020932521"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1542-6270", "JournalIssue": {"PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "Jun", "Day": "04"}}, "Title": "The Annals of pharmacotherapy", "ISOAbbreviation": "Ann Pharmacother"}, "ArticleTitle": "Lefamulin: The First Systemic Pleuromutilin Antibiotic.", "Pagination": {"MedlinePgn": "1060028020932521"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["<b>Objective:</b> To review the pharmacology, microbiology, efficacy, and safety of lefamulin. <b>Data Sources:</b> A literature search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar (2010 to end-April 2020) with the search terms <i>BC-3781</i> and <i>lefamulin</i>. Other resources included abstracts presented at recent conferences, prescribing information, and the manufacturer's and Food and Drug Administration websites. <b>Study Selection and Data Extraction:</b> All relevant English-language articles of studies assessing the efficacy and safety of lefamulin were included. <b>Data Synthesis:</b> Lefamulin is a pleuromutilin antibiotic with activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, and atypical bacteria. Lefamulin, given at the dose of 150 mg intravenously or 600 mg orally on an empty stomach every 12 hours for 5 to 7 days, was proven noninferior to moxifloxacin for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Common adverse reactions include injection site reactions, hepatic enzyme elevation, gastrointestinal upset, hypokalemia, insomnia, and headache. Lefamulin is associated with QT prolongation, and concomitant use with CYP3A substrates that prolong the QT interval is contraindicated. Lefamulin may cause fetal harm. <b>Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice:</b> Lefamulin is a novel antibiotic with a unique mechanism of action.

Maintenance of the biocompatibility and osteogenic characteristics of TNTs has been tested through cytotoxicity tests and osteogenic gene expression/extra-cellular matrix mineralization, respectively.

The TC nanoparticle-coated TNTs showed antibacterial activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and biocompatibility with MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts, while the osteogenic activity of the TNT structure was preserved, as demonstrated by osteocalcin and osteopontin gene expression, as well as Alizarin red staining.

Our current understanding of the metal-sequestering ability of CP is based on biochemical and functional studies performed at neutral or near-neutral pH. Nevertheless, CP can be present throughout the human body and is highly expressed at infection and inflammation sites that tend to be acidic. Here, we evaluate the metal-binding and antimicrobial properties of CP in the pH 5.0-7.0 range. We show that Ca(II)-induced tetramerization, an important process for the extracellular functions of CP, is perturbed by acidic conditions. Moreover, low pH impairs the antimicrobial activity of CP against some bacterial pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. At mildly acidic pH, CP loses the ability to deplete Mn from microbial growth medium, indicating that Mn(II) sequestration is attenuated under acidic conditions. Evaluation of the Mn(II)-binding properties of CP at pH 5.0-7.0 indicate that mildly acidic conditions lower the Mn(II)-binding affinity of the His6 site. Lastly, CP is less effective at preventing capture of Mn(II) by the bacterial solute-binding proteins MntC and PsaA at low pH. These results indicate that acidic conditions compromise the ability CP to sequester Mn(II) and thereby starve microbial pathogens of this nutrient. Broadly, this work highlights the importance of considering the chemical complexity of biological sites when describing the interplay between CP and microbes in host-pathogen interactions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosen", "ForeName": "Tomer", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nolan", "ForeName": "Elizabeth M", "Initials": "EM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0370623", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2960"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["32491853", "10.1021/acs.biochem.0c00359"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [["N-aryl pyrrothine", "antibacterial activity", "bacterial RNA polymerase", "dithiolopyrrolone", "inhibitors"]], "PMID": "32491252", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "06", "Day": "03"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "06", "Day": "03"}], "ELocationID": ["10.1111/cbdd.13736"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1747-0285", "JournalIssue": {"PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "Jun", "Day": "03"}}, "Title": "Chemical biology & drug design", "ISOAbbreviation": "Chem Biol Drug Des"}, "ArticleTitle": "Discovery of novel N-aryl pyrrothine derivatives as bacterial RNA polymerase inhibitors.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a validated drug target for broad-spectrum antibiotics, and its \"switch region\" is considered as the promising binding site for novel antibiotics.

The first approach included single or fractionated blue light application provided by LED emitters (470 nm), with the following fluencies: 16.29, 27.16 and 54.32 J/cm2. For the second approach a power LED (470 nm) was used to deliver 54.32 J/cm2 fractionated in 3 applications.

Furthermore, fungal growth was hidden by bacterial growth on blood agar subcultures from PAF bottles including combinations of <i>F. solani</i>, <i>C. glabrata</i> or <i>T. asahii</i> with bacteria.<b>Conclusion.</b> Blood culture bottles including selective fungal media that can allow selective growth of fungi and earlier detection of some species should be preferred in addition to non-selective blood culture bottles, especially in specific patient populations.

Plants such as, <i>Vetiveria zizanioides</i>, <i>Trichosanthes cucumerina</i>, and <i>Mollugo cerviana</i> were collected from Western Ghats, Tamilnadu, India. Phytochemicals were extracted from these plants using various organic solvents and tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The phytochemicals such as, carbohydrate, alkaloids, steroids, saponins, flavonoids and tannin were detected from these medicinal plants. Among the extracts, methanol showed potent activity and this solvent was used to extract polyherbal medicinal plants. Methanol extract of <i>V. zizanioides</i> was found to be highly active against <i>E. coli</i> (27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mm), <i>P. mirabilis</i> (19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0mm) and <i>B. subtilis</i> (18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mm). Ethyl acetate extract showed high activity against <i>E. coli</i> (24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mm), <i>P. mirabilis</i> (22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0mm) and <i>B. subtilis</i> (20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0mm). These three plants were taken at 1:1:1 ratio and extracted with methanol at 1:10 ratio and synergistic activity was tested against bacterial pathogens. Synergistic activity of polyherbal extract was analyzed. The extracted crude herbal medicine was found to be effective against <i>Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Enterbacter</i> sp.<i>, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis</i> and <i>Proteus mirabilis</i>. The zone of inhibition was 33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0mm, 17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mm, 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mm, 40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mm, 33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0mm and 38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mm zone of inhibition against <i>E. coli</i>, <i>S. aureus</i>, <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, <i>P. mirabilis</i>, <i>B. subtilis</i> and <i>Enterobacter</i> sp. Polyherbal extract was found to be highly effective against <i>P. mirabilis</i> and <i>Enterobacter</i> sp. MIC values of polyherbal extract ranged from 29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml to 34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml. MIC value was found to be less against <i>P. mirabilis</i> and was high against <i>S. aureus</i>. Antioxidant property varied between 49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03% and 95.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02%. At 20\u00a0\u00b5g/ml antioxidant activity was reported as 49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03% and it was increased at higher concentrations of polyherbal extract. Two cell lines (HeLa and MCF cell lines) were selected to analyze cytotoxic activity of polyherbal extract. The methanol extract of polyherbal fraction showed cytotoxicity against these two cell lines. The LC50 value was 467\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00a0\u00b5g/ml against HeLa cell line and >800\u00a0\u00b5g/ml against MCF-7 cell lines.

Among the identified bacterial species, <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>S. mutans</i>showed strong biofilm producing capacity. The other isolated bacteria, <i>Streptococcus sanguis</i>, <i>S. salivarius</i> showed moderate biofilm formation. These pathogens were subjected for the production of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) in nutrient broth medium and the strain <i>S. aureus</i> synthesized more amounts of EPS (610\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.2\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) than <i>S. sanguis</i> (480\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.8\u00a0\u00b5g/ml).EPS production was found to be less in <i>S. salivarius</i> (52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8\u00a0\u00b5g/ml).The solvent extract of <i>A. sativum</i> bulb showed the phytochemicals such as, carbohydrate, total protein, alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, tannins and sterioids. The solvent extract of <i>A. sativum</i> bulb showed wide ranges of activity against the selected dental pathogens. The difference in antibacterial activity of the solvent extract revealed differences in solubility of phytochemicals in organic solvents. Ethanol extract was highly active againstS. aureus (25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mm). The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of crude garlic bulb varied widely and this clearly showed that bacteria exhibits different level of susceptibility to secondary metabolites.

acids to enhance the solubility and antibiofilm activity of RIF. After performing phase-solubility studies that demonstrated a considerable increase in the solubility of RIF for the MC, the corresponding solid system was prepared by a freeze-drying method. Characterization of the MC was performed by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, thermal analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. Structural analyses evidenced molecular interactions between the components, resulting in a MC with amorphous solid features. Structural studies involving both experimental (i.e., <sup>1</sup>H NMR) and theoretical (i.e., molecular modeling) methodologies demonstrated the inclusion of the RIF piperazine ring in the \u03b2-CD cavity. The bioactivity of the MC measured against biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus showed a significant reduction in the metabolic activity of the bacterium. Overall, the studied MC exhibited promising properties for the development of pharmaceutical formulations to treat bacterial infections."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unidad de Investigaci\u00f3n y Desarrollo en Tecnolog\u00eda Farmac\u00e9utica, UNITEFA-CONICET, Facultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas, Departamento de Ciencias Farmac\u00e9uticas, Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, Haya de la Torre y Medina Allende, s/n.

One of the mechanisms of resistance within a biofilm is retardation of drug diffusion due to poor penetration across the matrix. To overcome this challenge, this work set to investigate novel counter ion approach with acidic amino acids, which we hypothesised will disrupt the biofilm matrix as well as simultaneously improve drug effectiveness. The anti-biofilm activity of D-Asp and D-Glu was studied on Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Synergistic effect of combining D-amino acids with Cip was also investigated as a strategy to overcome anti-microbial resistance in these biofilms. Interestingly at equimolar combinations, D-Asp and D-Glu were able to significantly disperse (at 20\u2009mM and 40\u2009mM) established biofilms and inhibit (at 10\u2009mM, 20\u2009mM and 40\u2009mM) new biofilm formation in the absence of an antibiotic. Moreover, our study confirmed L-amino acids also exhibit anti-biofilm activity. The synergistic effect of acidic amino acids with Cip was observed at lower concentration ranges (<40\u2009mM amino acids and <90.54\u2009\u00b5M, respectively), which resulted in 96.89% (inhibition) and 97.60% (dispersal) reduction in CFU with exposure to 40\u2009mM amino acids.

antibiotics such as rifampicin, streptomycin and fluoroquinolones, which are also used against other pathogenic bacteria. We developed Drug Resistance Associated Genes database (DRAGdb), a manually curated repository of mutational data of drug resistance associated genes (DRAGs) across ESKAPE (i.e. Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.) pathogens, and other bacteria with a special focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Analysis of mutations in drug-resistant genes listed in DRAGdb suggested both homoplasy and pleiotropy to be associated with resistance. Homoplasy was observed in six genes namely gidB, gyrA, gyrB, rpoB, rpsL and rrs. For these genes, drug resistance-associated mutations at codon level were conserved in MTB, ESKAPE and many other bacteria. Pleiotropy was exemplified by a single nucleotide mutation that was associated with resistance to amikacin, gentamycin, rifampicin and vancomycin in Staphylococcus aureus. DRAGdb data also revealed that mutations in some genes such as pncA, inhA, katG and embA,B,C were specific to Mycobacterium species. For inhA and pncA, the mutations in the promoter region along with those in coding regions were associated with resistance to isoniazid and pyrazinamide respectively. In summary, the DRAGdb database is a compilation of all the major MTB drug resistance genes across bacterial species, which allows identification of homoplasy and pleiotropy phenomena of DRAGs."]},

major health care problem. While initially restricted to clinical settings, drug resistant S. aureus is now one of the key causative agents of community-acquired infections. We have previously demonstrated that copper dependent inhibitors (CDIs), a class of antibiotics that are only active in the presence of copper ions, are effective bactericidal agents against MRSA. A second-generation CDI, APT-6K, exerted bactericidal activity at nanomolar concentrations. At sub-bactericidal concentrations, it effectively synergized with ampicillin to reverse drug resistance in multiple MRSA strains. APT-6K had a favorable therapeutic index when tested on eukaryotic cells (TI:\u2009>\u200930) and, unlike some previously reported CDIs, did not affect mitochondrial activity. These results further establish inhibitors that are activated by the binding of transition metal ions as a promising class of antibiotics, and for the first time, describe their ability to reverse existing drug resistance against clinically relevant antibiotics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at

{"AbstractText": ["Efflux is an important mechanism in Gram-negative bacteria conferring multidrug resistance. Inhibition of efflux is an encouraging strategy to restore the antibacterial activity of antibiotics. Chlorpromazine and amitriptyline have been shown to behave as efflux inhibitors. However, their mode of action is poorly understood. Exposure of <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium and <i>Escherichia coli</i> to chlorpromazine selected for mutations within genes encoding RamR and MarR, regulators of the multidrug tripartite efflux pump AcrAB-TolC. Further experiments with <i>S.</i> Typhimurium containing AcrB D408A (a nonfunctional efflux pump) and chlorpromazine or amitriptyline resulted in the reversion of the mutant <i>acrB</i> allele to the wild type. Together, this suggests these drugs are AcrB efflux substrates. Subsequent docking studies with AcrB from <i>S.</i> Typhimurium and <i>E. coli</i>, followed by molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations showed that chlorpromazine and amitriptyline bind at the hydrophobic trap, a preferred binding site for substrates and inhibitors within the distal binding pocket of AcrB. Based on these simulations, we suggest that chlorpromazine and amitriptyline inhibit AcrB-mediated efflux by interfering with substrate binding. Our findings provide evidence that these drugs are substrates and inhibitors of AcrB, yielding molecular details of their mechanism of action and informing drug discovery of new efflux inhibitors.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Efflux pumps of the resistance nodulation-cell division (RND) superfamily are major contributors to multidrug resistance for most of the Gram-negative ESKAPE (<i>Enterococcus faecium</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Enterobacter</i> species) pathogens. The development of inhibitors of these pumps would be highly desirable; however, several issues have thus far hindered all efforts at designing new efflux inhibitory compounds devoid of adverse effects. An alternative route to <i>de novo</i> design relies on the use of marketed drugs, for which side effects on human health have been already assessed. In this work, we provide experimental evidence that the antipsychotic drugs chlorpromazine and amitriptyline are inhibitors of the AcrB transporter, the engine of the major RND efflux pumps in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium. Furthermore, <i>in silico</i> calculations have provided a molecular-level picture of the inhibition mechanism, allowing rationalization of experimental data and paving the way for similar studies with other classes of marketed compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Grimsey et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Antimicrobials

Small RNA Regulatory Networks and Integration with Transcription Factor-Driven Regulatory Networks.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) are key regulators of bacterial gene expression. Through complementary base pairing, sRNAs affect mRNA stability and translation efficiency. Here, we describe a network inference approach designed to identify sRNA-mediated regulation of transcript levels. We use existing transcriptional data sets and prior knowledge to infer sRNA regulons using our network inference tool, the <i>Inferelator</i> This approach produces genome-wide gene regulatory networks that include contributions by both transcription factors and sRNAs. We show the benefits of estimating and incorporating sRNA activities into network inference pipelines using available experimental data. We also demonstrate how these estimated sRNA regulatory activities can be mined to identify the experimental conditions where sRNAs are most active. We uncover 45 novel experimentally supported sRNA-mRNA interactions in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, outperforming previous network-based efforts. Additionally, our pipeline complements sequence-based sRNA-mRNA interaction prediction methods by adding a data-driven filtering step. Finally, we show the general applicability of our approach by identifying 24 novel, experimentally supported, sRNA-mRNA interactions in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> Overall, our strategy generates novel insights into the functional context of sRNA regulation in multiple bacterial species.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Individual bacterial genomes can have dozens of small noncoding RNAs with largely unexplored regulatory functions. Although bacterial sRNAs influence a wide range of biological processes, including antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity, our current understanding of sRNA-mediated regulation is far from complete. Most of the available information is restricted to a few well-studied bacterial species; and even in those species, only partial sets of sRNA targets have been characterized in detail. To close this information gap, we developed a computational strategy that takes advantage of available transcriptional data and knowledge about validated and putative sRNA-mRNA interactions for inferring expanded sRNA regulons. Our approach facilitates the identification of experimentally supported novel interactions while filtering out false-positive results. Due to its data-driven nature, our method prioritizes biologically relevant interactions among lists of candidate sRNA-target pairs predicted <i>in silico</i> from sequence analysis or derived from sRNA-mRNA binding experiments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Arrieta-Ortiz et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, Department of Biology, New York University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, Washington, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arrieta-Ortiz", "ForeName": "Mario L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, Department of Biology, New York University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Identifier": ["https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6365-8254"], "LastName": "Hafemeister", "ForeName": "Christoph", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, Department of Biology, New York University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shuster", "ForeName": "Bentley", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, Washington, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baliga", "ForeName": "Nitin S", "Initials": "NS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, Department of Biology, New York University, New York, New York, USA rb133@nyu.edu pe19@nyu.edu."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Computational Biology, Flatiron Institute, New York, New York, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Data Science, New York University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bonneau", "ForeName": "Richard", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, Department of Biology, New York University, New York, New York, USA rb133@nyu.edu pe19@nyu.edu."}], "Identifier": ["https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6027-9651"], "LastName": "Eichenberger", "ForeName": "Patrick", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "mSystems", "NlmUniqueID": "101680636", "ISSNLinking": "2379-5077"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32487739", "5/3/e00057-20", "10.1128/mSystems.00057-20"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [["4-Nitrophenol", "Ag nanoparticles", "Antibacterial", "Eggshell", "Green synthesis"]], "PMID": "32487416", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "06", "Day": "03"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "04", "Day": "24"}], "ELocationID": ["S0928-4931(20)30097-7", "10.1016/j.msec.2020.111015"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1873-0191", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "113", "PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "Aug"}}, "Title": "Materials science & engineering.

For this, a series of copper oxide-titanium dioxide nanocomposites were synthesized by varying the composition of copper oxide (5%, 10%, and 20%) with titanium dioxide. The pure titanium dioxide and copper oxide-titanium dioxide nanocomposites were characterized by advanced instrumental techniques. XRD, TEM, FE-SEM, EDX, elemental mapping and XPS analysis results consistently revealed the successful formation of copper oxide-titanium dioxide nanocomposites using PLAL technique. The antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of pure titanium dioxide and copper oxide-titanium dioxide nanocomposites were investigated against biofilm-producing strains of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by various methods. Our results revealed that the PLAL synthesized copper oxide-titanium dioxide nanocomposites showed enhanced anti-biofilm and antibacterial activity compared to pure titanium dioxide in a dose-dependent manner against targeted pathogens. Furthermore, the effects of pure titanium dioxide and copper oxide-titanium dioxide nanocomposites on bacterial morphology, biofilm formation, aggregation and their colonization by targeted pathogens were also examined using scanning electron microscopy. Microscopic images clearly showed that the cell envelope of almost all the cells were rumples, rough, had irregularities and abnormal appearance with the major damage being characterized by the formation of \"pits\". Many depressions and indentations were also seen in their cell envelope and the original shape of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells changed from normal rod to swollen, large and elongated which indicates the loss of membrane integrity and damage of cell wall and membrane.

The physical and chemical properties of the produced materials were extensively characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field-emission gun transmission electron microscopy (FEG-TEM), ultraviolet and visible absorption (UV-Vis), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and ion release determination. The results demonstrated that AgNPs/r-GO composites were successfully produced, revealing the formation of micrometer-sized r-GO sheets decorated by AgNPs of approximately 70\u00a0nm diameter. Finally, bactericidal and photobactericidal effects of the AgNPs/r-GO composites were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, in which the results showed that the composites presented antimicrobial and photoantimicrobial activities. Moreover, our results demonstrated for the first time, to our knowledge, that an efficient process of bacterial inactivation can be achieved by using AgNPs/r-GO composites under blue light irradiation as a result of three different bacterial killing processes: (i) chemical effect promoted by Ag<sup>+</sup> ion release from AgNPs; (ii) photocatalytic activity induced by AgNPs/r-GO composites, enhancing the bacterial photoinactivation due to the excited-Plasmons of the AgNPs when anchored on r-GO; and (iii) photodynamic effect produced by bacterial endogenous photosensitizers under blue-light irradiation.

The parent and modified graphenic surfaces were thoroughly characterized by \u03bcRaman spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, scanning electron microscopy, contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, work function and microbiological tests. It was found that even the short time of plasma modification results in a significant increase in work function, surface free energy and hydrophilicity. The changes in surface chemistry stimulate also substantial changes in bacterial adhesion. The strong relationship between work function and adhesion of bacteria was observed for all the investigated strains (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) whereas the bacterial colonization trend correlates with the bacterial zeta potential. The bacteria-graphenic surface interaction is discussed in terms of total interaction energy.

Recently, livestock-associated methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (LA-MRSA), usually cultured in farm animals, were detected in CF airways. Although some of these strains are able to establish severe infections in humans, there is limited knowledge about the role of LA-MRSA virulence in CF lung disease. To address this issue, we analyzed LA-MRSA, hospital-associated (HA-) MRSA and methicillin-susceptible <i>S.</i><i>aureus</i> (MSSA) clinical isolates recovered early in the course of airway infection and several years after persistence in this hostile environment from pulmonary specimens of nine CF patients regarding important virulence traits such as their hemolytic activity, biofilm formation, invasion in airway epithelial cells, cytotoxicity, and antibiotic susceptibility. We detected that CF LA-MRSA isolates were resistant to tetracycline, more hemolytic and cytotoxic than HA-MRSA, and more invasive than MSSA. Despite the residence in the animal host, LA-MRSA still represent a serious threat to humans, as such clones possess a virulence potential similar or even higher than that of HA-MRSA. Furthermore, we confirmed that <i>S. aureus</i> individually adapts to the airways of CF patients, which eventually impedes the success of antistaphylococcal therapy of airway infections in CF."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, 48149 M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Hygiene, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, 48149 M\u00fcnster, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Treffon", "ForeName": "Janina", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, 48149 M\u00fcnster, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fotiadis", "ForeName": "Sarah Ann", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, 48149 M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Business Unit Pain, Gr\u00fcnenthal GmbH, 52222 Stolberg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Alen", "ForeName": "Sarah", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, 48149 M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Friedrich Loeffler-Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Medicine Greifswald, 17475 Greifswald, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Becker", "ForeName": "Karsten", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, 48149 M\u00fcnster, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kahl", "ForeName": "Barbara C", "Initials": "BC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "03ZZ0802H and 01KI1727A", "Agency": "Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Bildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "Transregional Collaborative Research Center 34 (C7)", "Agency": "Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "1806", "Agency": "Mukoviszidose e.V.", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Toxins (Basel)", "NlmUniqueID": "101530765", "ISSNLinking": "2072-6651"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "08"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32486247", "toxins12060360", "10.3390/toxins12060360"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [["HCT116", "MCF 7", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "Staphylococcus aureus", "antibacterial activity", "antitumoral activity", "heterocycles", "pyrrolic nucleus", "pyrrolomycin"]], "PMID": "32486200", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "06", "Day": "03"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "30"}], "ELocationID": ["E292", "10.3390/antibiotics9060292"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "2079-6382", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "9", "Issue": "6", "PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "May", "Day": "30"}}, "Title": "Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)", "ISOAbbreviation": "Antibiotics (Basel)"}, "ArticleTitle": "New Synthetic Nitro-Pyrrolomycins as Promising Antibacterial and Anticancer Agents.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["<b>:</b> Pyrrolomycins (PMs) are polyhalogenated antibiotics known as powerful biologically active compounds, yet featuring high cytotoxicity.

This formulation becomes a gel in-situ once reached body temperature, allowing an optimal coating of the mesh along with the surrounding tissues. In vitro, the hydrogel cytotoxicity was assessed using rabbit fibroblasts and antimicrobial efficacy was determined against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. An in vivo rabbit model of hernia repair was performed; implanted polypropylene meshes (5 \u00d7 2 cm) were challenged with <i>S. aureus</i> (10<sup>6</sup> CFU), for two study groups-unloaded (n = 4) and 0.1 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> rifampicin-loaded hydrogel (n = 8). In vitro, antibacterial activity of the hydrogel lasted for 5 days, without sign of cytotoxicity. Fourteen days after implantation, meshes coated with drug-free hydrogel developed a strong infection and resulted in poor tissue integration. Coating meshes with the rifampicin-loaded hydrogel fully prevented implant infection and permitted an optimal tissue integration.

In this paper, three different 4-sulfonylmethyl chalcones are coated onto cotton cloths with acacia as the binder using a padding mangle to make them antibacterial. A 99% reduction in the adhesion of three slime producing organisms, namely Staphylococcus aureus NCIM5021, Escherichia coli NCIM2931 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCIM2901, on these surfaces was observed. The coated surfaces are more hydrophobic than the original one. The attachment of the bacteria (CFU ml<sup>-1</sup>) to the cloth is directly proportional (correlation coefficient, R = 0.58) to the hydrophobicity of the surface of the microorganism. The extent of bacterial attachment on the cloths (CFU ml<sup>-1</sup>) is not correlated with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the chalcones (R = -0.1), but on the other hand it is negatively correlated with the hydrophilicity of the coated cloth (R = -0.52). This indicates that hydrophilic surfaces prevent bacterial attachment and hydrophobic organisms have a greater propensity to attach to hydrophobic surfaces than hydrophilic ones. A simple multi-linear regression model with the surface hydrophobicity of the organism and the hydrophilicity of the cloth is able to predict the extent of bacterial attachment. This study suggests that the coated cloths could find applications in hospital environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Adyar, Chennai 600036, India. mukeshd@iitm.ac.in."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sivakumar", "ForeName": "Ponnurengam Malliappan", "Initials": "PM", "Suffix": ""}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prabhawathi", "ForeName": "Veluchamy", "Initials": "V", "Suffix": ""}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neelakandan", "ForeName": "Ramalingam", "Initials": "R", "Suffix": ""}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Doble", "ForeName": "Mukesh", "Initials": "M", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomater Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101593571", "ISSNLinking": "2047-4830"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32481972", "10.1039/c3bm60312a"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [["Co-assembly", "Enhanced activity", "Enzyme cascade", "Glucose oxidase", "P450 OleT", "Terminal alkenes"]], "PMID": "32485602", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "06", "Day": "02"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "15"}], "ELocationID": ["S0960-8524(20)30810-5", "10.1016/j.biortech.2020.123538"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1873-2976", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "311", "PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "May", "Day": "15"}}, "Title": "Bioresource technology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Bioresour.

These infections are commonly associated with antibiotic-tolerant Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Engineered cationic amphipathic peptide WLBU2 has shown the ability to kill antibiotic-resistant pathogens and drug-tolerant bacterial biofilms. The novelty of using WLBU2 during the direct irrigation and debridement of periprosthetic joint infections led our group to investigate the optimal washout conditions for treatment of S. aureus biofilms. S. aureus mature biofilms were grown on metal implant material and treated with WLBU2 dissolved in differing irrigation solvents. Mature biofilms were treated both in vitro as well as in a periprosthetic joint infection murine model. WLBU2 activity against S. aureus biofilms was increased when dissolved in dPBS with pH of 7.0 compared to normal saline with pH of 5.5. WLBU2 activity was decreased in acidic dPBS and increased in alkaline dPBS. WLBU2 activity could be decreased in hypertonic dPBS and increased in hypotonic dPBS. WLBU2 dissolved in less acidic dPBS displayed increased efficacy in treating PJI implants ex vivo. WLBU2 demonstrated the ability to eliminate PJI associated S. aureus biofilms on arthroplasty material. The efficacy of engineered cationic amphipathic peptide WLBU2 for intraoperative elimination of S. aureus biofilms can be further optimized when kept in a less acidic and more physiologic pH adjusted saline. Understanding optimal physical washout conditions are vital for the success of WLBU2 in treating S. aureus biofilms in PJI clinical trials going forward. This article is protected by copyright.

However, the features that dictate the metal utilized by metalloenzymes are poorly understood, limiting our ability to manipulate these enzymes for industrial and health-associated applications. The ubiquitous iron/manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD) family exemplifies this deficit, as the specific metal used by any family member cannot be predicted. Biochemical, structural and paramagnetic analysis of two evolutionarily related SODs with different metal specificity produced by the pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus identifies two positions that control metal specificity. These residues make no direct contacts with the metal-coordinating ligands but control the metal's redox properties, demonstrating that subtle architectural changes can dramatically alter metal utilization. Introducing these mutations into S. aureus alters the ability of the bacterium to resist superoxide stress when metal starved by the host, revealing that small changes in metal-dependent activity can drive the evolution of metalloenzymes with new cofactor specificity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences, Faculty of

In addition to peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is an especially important component of the <i>S. aureus</i> cell envelope. LTA is an anionic polymer anchored to a glycolipid in the outer leaflet of the cell membrane. It was known that deleting the gene for UgtP, the enzyme that makes this glycolipid anchor, causes cell growth and division defects. In <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, growth abnormalities from the loss of <i>ugtP</i> have been attributed to both the absence of the encoded protein and to the loss of its products. Here, we show that growth defects in <i>S. aureus ugtP</i> deletion mutants are due to the long, abnormal LTA polymer that is produced when the glycolipid anchor is missing from the outer leaflet of the membrane. Dysregulated cell growth leads to defective cell division, and these phenotypes are corrected by mutations in the LTA polymerase, <i>ltaS</i>, that reduce polymer length. We also show that <i>S. aureus</i> mutants with long LTA are sensitized to cell wall hydrolases, beta-lactam antibiotics, and compounds that target other cell envelope pathways. We conclude that control of LTA polymer length is important for <i>S. aureus</i> physiology and promotes survival under stressful conditions, including antibiotic stress.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) is a common cause of community- and hospital-acquired infections and is responsible for a large fraction of deaths caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. <i>S. aureus</i> is surrounded by a complex cell envelope that protects it from antimicrobial compounds and other stresses. Here we show that controlling the length of an essential cell envelope polymer, lipoteichoic acid, is critical for controlling <i>S. aureus</i> cell size and cell envelope integrity. We also show that genes involved in LTA length regulation are required for resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in MRSA. The proteins encoded by these genes may be targets for combination therapy with an appropriate beta-lactam."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 American Society for Microbiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}], "Identifier": ["https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5929-6825"], "LastName": "Hesser", "ForeName": "Anthony R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matano", "ForeName": "Leigh M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vickery", "ForeName": "Christopher R", "Initials": "CR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wood", "ForeName": "B McKay", "Initials": "BM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Santiago", "ForeName": "Ace George", "Initials": "AG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morris", "ForeName": "Heidi G", "Initials": "HG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Do", "ForeName": "Truc", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Losick", "ForeName": "Richard", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA suzanne_walker@hms.harvard.edu."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walker", "ForeName": "Suzanne", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Bacteriol", "NlmUniqueID": "2985120R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9193"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["32482719", "JB.00149-20", "10.1128/JB.00149-20"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [["IV-to-PO switch", "Middle East", "antibiotic therapy", "economics", "length of stay"]], "PMID": "32482613", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "06", "Day": "02"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "29"}], "ELocationID": ["S1876-0341(20)30431-7", "10.1016/j.jiph.2020.03.018"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1876-035X", "JournalIssue": {"PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "May", "Day": "29"}}, "Title": "Journal of infection and public health", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Infect Public Health"}, "ArticleTitle": "Early switch/early discharge opportunities for hospitalized patients with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus complicated skin and soft tissue infections: Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["To describe opportunities for early switch (ES) from intravenous (IV) to oral (PO) antibiotics and early discharge (ED) of patients hospitalized in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTIs).", "This retrospective medical chart review study enrolled physicians from sixteen KSA and UAE sites to collect data for 107 MRSA cSSTI patients.", "Actual length of MRSA-active treatment was 13.3\u00b19.3 mean days in KSA and 11.2\u00b13.9 mean days in UAE, with a mean of 11.8\u00b19.3 days of MRSA-targeted IV therapy in KSA and 10.7\u00b14.3 days in UAE. 12.5% in KSA met ES criteria and potentially could have discontinued IV therapy 4.0\u00b12.9 days sooner; 44.0% in UAE could have discontinued 6.6\u00b13.6 days sooner.

In this study, we found that the natural compound oleanolic acid (OA) and its analogues (especially corosolic acid (CA)) significantly inhibited the activity of important \u03b2-lactamases (NDM-1, KPC-2, and VIM-1) in Enterobacteriaceae and \u03b2-lactamases (\u03b2-lactamase N1) in <i>S. aureus</i>. The results showed significant synergy with \u03b2-lactams against \u03b2-lactamase-positive bacteria (fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index <0.5). Additionally, OA treatment significantly inhibited the activity of hemolysin from various bacteria. In the mouse infection models, the combined therapy with OA and \u03b2-lactams exhibited a significant synergistic effect in the treatment of \u03b2-lactamase-producing bacteria, as evidenced by the survival rate of <i>S. aureus</i>- or <i>Escherichia coli</i>-infected mice, which increased from 25.0 to 75.0% or from 44.4 to 61.1% (CA increased to 77.8%), respectively, compared to treatment with individual \u03b2-lactams. Although OA treatment alone led to systemic protection against <i>S. aureus</i>-infected mice by directly targeting \u03b1-hemolysin (Hla), a relatively better therapeutic effect was observed for the combined therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to find effective inhibitors against resistant bacterial infections with a two-pronged strategy by simultaneously targeting resistance enzymes and toxins, which may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for drug-resistant bacterial infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 American Chemical Society."}, "AuthorList":

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are a major public health burden. Patients suffering from chronic respiratory disease are prone to persistent, debilitating respiratory infections due to the decreased ability to clear pathogens from the respiratory tract. Such infections often develop into chronic, life-long complications that are difficult to treat with antibiotics due to the formation of recalcitrant biofilms. The microbial communities present in the upper and lower respiratory tracts change as these respiratory diseases progress, often becoming less diverse and dysbiotic, correlating with worsening patient morbidity. Those with chronic respiratory disease are commonly infected with a shared group of respiratory pathogens including <i>Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Moraxella catarrhalis</i>, among others. In order to understand the microbial landscape of the respiratory tract during chronic disease, we review the known inter-species interactions among these organisms and other common respiratory flora. We consider both the balance between cooperative and competitive interactions in relation to microbial community structure. By reviewing the major causes of chronic respiratory disease, we identify common features across disease states and signals that might contribute to community shifts. As microbiome shifts have been associated with respiratory disease progression, worsening morbidity, and increased mortality, these underlying community interactions likely have an impact on respiratory disease state."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Welp and Bomberger."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology

Examples include prosthesis, catheters and electrical drivelines. Percutaneous devices breach the skin's natural barrier and create an entry point for pathogens, making device infections a widespread problem. Modification of the percutaneous implant surface to increase skin integration with the aim to reduce subsequent infection is attracting a great deal of attention. While novel surfaces have been tested in various <i>in vitro</i> models used to study skin integration around percutaneous devices, no skin model has been reported, for the study of bacterial infection around percutaneous devices. Here, we report the establishment of an <i>in vitro</i> human skin equivalent model for driveline infections caused by <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, the most common cause of driveline-related infections. Three types of mock drivelines manufactured using melt electrowriting (smooth or porous un-seeded and porous pre-seeded with human fibroblasts) were implanted in human skin constructs and challenged with <i>S. aureus.</i> Our results show a high and stable load of <i>S. aureus</i> in association with the skin surface and no signs of <i>S. aureus</i>-induced tissue damage. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that bacterial migration along the driveline surface occurs in micro-gaps caused by insufficient skin integration between the driveline and the surrounding skin consistent with clinical reports from explanted patient drivelines. Thus, the human skin-driveline infection model presented here provides a clinically-relevant and versatile experimental platform for testing novel device surfaces and infection therapeutics."],

Although previous studies proposed an action mechanism-creating a physical barrier in the teat canal to prevent bacterial invasion-it has not been proven experimentally. We hypothesized that bismuth subnitrate has an inhibitory effect on bacterial growth, in addition to its barrier effect. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of bismuth subnitrate on bacterial growth of major mastitis-causing agents. A strain of Streptococcus uberis (SR115), 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (SA3971/59 and SA1), and a strain of Escherichia coli (P17.14291) were tested in vitro for their ability to grow in the presence or absence of bismuth subnitrate. Disk diffusion testing, impedance measurement, and evaluation of bacterial growth in shaking conditions were the methods used to test this hypothesis. A reduction of growth in the presence of bismuth subnitrate occurred for all the strains tested. However, we observed strain and species variations in the extent of growth inhibition. These results suggest that an inhibitory effect on bacterial growth by bismuth subnitrate could partially explain the efficacy of bismuth-based formulations for preventing intramammary infections over the dry period.

Here we report that S.\u00a0aureus regulates the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle via the production of pyruvate for tolerance to betamethasone valerate (BV), an anti-inflammatory drug used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. The addition of BV or clobetasol propionate to the medium among 5 different anti-inflammatory steroids delayed the growth of S.\u00a0aureus. Comprehensive gene expression analysis by RNA-seq revealed that BV increased the expression of genes related to glycolysis in S.\u00a0aureus. Pyruvate, a product of glycolysis, suppressed the S.\u00a0aureus growth inhibition by BV. The addition of oxaloacetate, a compound in the TCA cycle biosynthesized from pyruvate, was also suppressed the inhibitory effect of BV. Malonate, an inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase in the TCA cycle, increased the inhibitory effect of BV on the growth of S.\u00a0aureus.

An in vivo murine excisional wound splinting model, followed by the experimental infection of the wounds with S. aureus and their treatment with the synthesized dressings, pointed to the reduction of the bacterial load in wounds after 7 days, though the total elimination of the infection was not reached.

MRSA viability assay showed the micelles had a percentage killing of 93.39% when compared bare-VCM (58.21%) at the same MIC (0.98 \u03bcg/ml). In vivo mice (BALB/c) skin infection models showed an 8-fold reduction in MRSA burden after treatment with VCM-OLA-SPDA-micelles when compared with bare VCM.

Subsequent CHIPS toxicology studies in animal models were promising. However, during a small phase-I trial, healthy human volunteers showed adverse effects directly after CHIPS administration. Subjects showed clinical signs of anaphylaxis with mild leukocytopenia and increased C-reactive protein concentrations, suggesting an inflammatory response, which are possibly related to the presence of relatively high circulating anti-CHIPS antibodies. Even though our data in mice show CHIPS as a potential anti-inflammatory agent, safety issues in human subjects temper the use of CHIPS in its current form as a therapeutic candidate.

However, correct identification of this lineage is difficult because of the similar characteristics to S.\u00a0aureus. Here, we describe the first known case of keratoconjunctivitis due to S.\u00a0argenteus in a 64-year-old man with diabetes. The symptoms of the patient were not improved by antibiotic therapy using levofloxacin eye drops (15 mg/mL). The conjunctival scraping was cultured, and coagulase-positive staphylococci forming white colonies were detected. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry confirmed the species as S.\u00a0argenteus with a spectral score of 1.97. After the antibiotic was changed to vancomycin eye drops (10 mg/mL), the patient's symptom clearly improved. Multi-locus sequence typing showed that this isolate belonged to sequence type 1223, which has been predominantly isolated worldwide. Furthermore, this isolate harbored various virulence genes associated with S.\u00a0aureus, such as staphylococcal enterotoxins and leukocidin. Since only limited information is available for this organism, further studies are needed to establish the epidemiology of S.\u00a0argenteus."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases.

Evaluated parameters included clinical parameters (body temperature and heart and respiratory rates), blood acute phase proteins and leukocyte counts, and leukocytes and proteins in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Mild clinical signs with increased heart rates and rectal temperatures developed following administration of the lysate, with resolution by 24\u2009h. Serum haptoglobin and plasma fibrinogen concentrations were elevated at 24\u2009h relative to baseline. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) had increased cellularity and increased proportion of neutrophils, as well as higher concentrations of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10 and total protein at 24\u2009h relative to baseline. Mass spectrometry identified 965 unique proteins in BALF: 19 proteins were increased and 26 proteins were decreased relative to baseline. The upregulated proteins included those involved in innate immunity including activation of complement, neutrophils and platelets. At postmortem examination, calves receiving higher doses of lysate had areas of lobular consolidation and interlobular edema. Histologically, neutrophils were present within bronchioles and to a lesser extent within alveoli. Calves receiving highest doses of lysate had patchy areas of neutrophils, hemorrhage and hyaline membranes within alveoli.", "Aerosolization of bacterial lysate stimulated an innate immune response in lungs and airways, with alveolar damage observed at higher doses.

Among causative pathogens,<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>is prominently known as the underlying cause of many multidrug resistant infections that are often treated with the first-line choice antibiotic vancomycin (VCM).

The aim of this work was to prepare, characterize and evaluate VCM-loaded nanoparticles (VNp) for use against<i>S. aureus</i>strains. Moreover, conjugation of Nps with holo-transferrin (h-Tf) was investigated as an approach for improving targeted drug delivery. VNp were prepared by double emulsion solvent evaporation method using PLGA and PVA or DMAB as surfactants. The particles were characterized for size distribution, Zeta Potential, morphology by transmission electron microscopy, encapsulation yield and protein conjugation efficiency. Process yield and drug loading were also investigated along with an<i>in vitro</i>evaluation of VNp antimicrobial effects against<i>S. aureus</i>strains. Results showed that Np were spontaneously formed with a mean diameter lower than 300 nm in a narrow size distribution that presented a spherical shape. The bioconjugation with h-Tf did not appear to increase the antimicrobial effect of VNp. However, non-bioconjugated Np presented a minimal inhibitory concentration lower than free VCM against a MRSA (Methicillin-resistant<i>S. aureus</i>) strain, and slightly higher against a VISA (VCM intermediate<i>S. aureus</i>) strain.

To analyze organization of bacteria and EPS in high resolution and high magnification by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), it is important to preserve the complex architecture of biofilms. Therefore, fixation abilities of formalin, glutaraldehyde, and Methacarn (methanol/chloroform/acetic acid-6:3:1) fixatives were evaluated to identify which fixative would best preserve the complex structure of bacterial biofilms. Economically important Gram-negative Mannheimia haemolytica, the major pathogen associated with bovine respiratory disease complex, and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, the major cause of chronic mastitis in cattle, bacteria were selected since both form biofilms on solid-liquid interface. For SEM analysis, round glass coverslips were placed into the wells of 24-well plates and diluted M. haemolytica or S. aureus cultures were added, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48-72 h under static growth conditions. Culture media were aspirated and biofilms were fixed with an individual fixative for 48 h. SEM examination revealed that all three fixatives were effective preserving the bacterial cell morphology, however only Methacarn fixative could consistently preserve the complex structure of biofilms.

Contrasting with the adjacent conjunctiva and other body surfaces, it also lacks a resident viable bacterial microbiome. Corneal resistance to microbes depends on intrinsic defenses involving tear fluid and the corneal epithelium. Dry eye, an ocular surface disease associated with discomfort and inflammation, can alter tear fluid composition and volume, and impact epithelial integrity. We previously showed that experimentally-induced dry eye (EDE) in mice does not increase corneal susceptibility to P. aeruginosa infection. Here, we explored if EDE alters corneal resistance to bacterial colonization. EDE was established in mice using scopolamine injections and dehumidified air-flow, and verified by phenol-red thread testing after 5 and 10 days. As expected, EDE corneas showed increased fluorescein staining versus controls consistent with compromised epithelial barrier function. Confocal imaging using mT/mG knock-in mice with red-fluorescent membranes revealed no other obvious morphological differences between EDE corneas and controls for epithelium, stroma, and endothelium. EDE corneas were imaged ex vivo and compared to controls after alkyne-functionalized D-alanine labeling of metabolically-active colonizing bacteria, or by FISH using a universal 16S rRNA gene probe. Both methods revealed very few viable bacteria on EDE corneas after 5 or 10 days (median of 0, upper quartile of \u2264 1 bacteria per field of view for each group [9-12 eyes per group]) similar to control corneas. Furthermore, there was no obvious difference in abundance of conjunctival bacteria, which included previously reported filamentous forms. Thus, despite reduced tear flow and apparent compromise to corneal barrier function (fluorescein staining), EDE murine corneas continue to resist bacterial colonization and maintain the absence of a resident viable bacterial microbiome."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Vision Science Program, University of California, Berkeley, CA, United States of America."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Stephanie J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Optometry, University of California, Berkeley, CA, United States of America."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Sophia", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Optometry, University of California, Berkeley, CA, United States of America."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Touro University California, Vallejo, CA, United States of America."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Evans", "ForeName": "David J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Vision Science Program, University of California, Berkeley, CA, United States of America."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Optometry, University of California, Berkeley, CA, United States of America."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Groups in Microbiology, and Infectious Diseases & Immunity, University of California, Berkeley, CA, United States of America."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6324-3462"], "LastName": "Fleiszig", "ForeName": "Suzanne M J", "Initials": "SMJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "PLoS One", "NlmUniqueID": "101285081", "ISSNLinking": "1932-6203"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "02", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32470039", "10.1371/journal.pone.0234013", "PONE-D-20-03918"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [], "PMID": "32470006", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "06", "Day": "01"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "29"}], "ELocationID": ["10.1371/journal.pone.0233854"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1932-6203", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "15", "Issue": "5", "PubDate": {"Year": "2020"}}, "Title": "PloS one", "ISOAbbreviation": "PLoS ONE"}, "ArticleTitle": "S. aureus alpha-toxin monomer binding and heptamer formation in host cell membranes - Do they determine sensitivity of airway epithelial cells toward the toxin?", "Pagination": {"MedlinePgn": "e0233854"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Alpha-toxin (Hla) is a major virulence factor of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and plays an important role in S. aureus-induced pneumonia.

SEM investigations show that the nanoparticles having a spherical shape with diameter ranged from 26 to 37\u00a0nm depending on the laser energy. The antibacterial activity and minimal inhibition concentration of synthesized CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were examined. Bacterial adhesion test of cerium oxide NPs was also determined under different incubation temperatures. Cytotoxicity of CeO<sub>2</sub> NP effect against the human throat cancer was studied. The cytotoxicity effect of CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs synthesized at 160\u00a0mJ on the cancer cells caused a free radical releasing which causing oxidative stress. The cytotoxicity effects of ceria NPs against human throat cancer (RD rhabdomyosarcoma cell line) and mouse fibroblast L cell (L20B cell line) growth were 33% and 13%, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Sciences, University of Almustansiriyah, Baghdad, Iraq."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abid", "ForeName": "Suhad A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Sciences, University of Technology, Baghdad, Iraq."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taha", "ForeName": "Ali A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Sciences, University of Technology, Baghdad, Iraq. raidismail@yahoo.com."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6629-3630"], "LastName": "Ismail", "ForeName": "Raid A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Sciences, University of Technology, Baghdad, Iraq."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohsin", "ForeName": "Mayyadah H", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["32468358", "10.1007/s11356-020-09332-9", "10.1007/s11356-020-09332-9"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [], "PMID": "32468182", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "29"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "28"}], "ELocationID": ["10.1007/s00284-020-02049-5"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1432-0991", "JournalIssue": {"PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "May", "Day": "28"}}, "Title": "Current microbiology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Curr.

Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Masson trichrome, and a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) kit. Defect diameter was calculated using the Visus Image Analysis System. <b>\n                        <i>Results:</i>\n                    </b> The irradiated group had more epithelial cells and richer granulation tissue compared to those in the other groups. The irradiation group had a significantly smaller defect size than the nonirradiation group (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01) and the control group (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). The amount of collagen was highest in the irradiation group and was graded as 3, 2, and 3+ in the control, nonirradiation, and irradiation groups, respectively. The percentage of PCNA in the control group was significantly lower than that in the other two groups (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). <b>\n                        <i>Conclusions:</i>\n                    </b> PBM therapy (660\u2009nm) promoted cell proliferation and collagen synthesis, thereby improving the wound healing response to an <i>S. aureus</i> infection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Interventional Radiology, Qingdao Municipal Hospital, Qingdao, Shandong, P.R.

Therefore, the need to discover novel materials that can combat pathogenic microorganisms is ongoing. Novel technologies, such as the potential use of nanomaterials and nanocomposites, hold promise for reducing these infections in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. In this study, the antimicrobial activity of tungsten, tungsten carbide and tungsten oxide nanoparticles were tested against <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and bacteriophage T4 (DNA virus). The most potent nanoparticles, tungsten oxide, were incorporated into polymeric fibres using pressurised gyration and characterised using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.

Temporary reduction in bioavailable iron represents a potential therapeutic target in sepsis. This study investigates the effect of the novel iron chelator, DIBI, in murine models of systemic (hyper-)inflammation: C57BL/6 mice were challenged with toxins from Gram-positive (<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>: lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan) and Gram-negative bacteria (<i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>: lipopolysaccharide). Intravital microscopy (IVM) was performed to assess immune cell activation and its impact on microvascular blood flow in vivo in the microcirculation of the gut. Plasma inflammatory mediators were measured via multiplex assay, and morphologic change in intestinal tissue was evaluated. DIBI treatment decreased leukocyte (hyper-)activation induced by Gram-positive and Gram-negative toxins. In some cases, it preserved capillary perfusion, reduced plasma inflammatory markers and attenuated tissue damage.

Biofilm, a population of bacteria within a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substance, decreases the susceptibility to antibiotics, immune defenses and contributes to antimicrobial resistance. To date antibiotic combination has been considered a strategy to combat S. aureus infection, but this approach does not solves the main pharmacokinetic problem caused by biofilms, consisting in insufficient drug penetration within the structure. Therefore, new antimicrobial agents that could overcome this resistance need to be discovered. Fighting staphylococcal resistance and biofilm formation is an important goal of the pharmaceutical research. Some fungicide has been observed to have antibacterial effect anyway their use as antibiotics on S.aureus has been poorly studied. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of the fungicide itraconazole (IT) on S. aureus biofilm formation and explore by SEM the morphological alteration after treatment. A strong biofilm disaggregation and morphologically different extracellular vesicles (EV) production were observed starting from sublethal IT doses. This suggests that IT resistance phenomena on the part of S. aureus are more difficult to establish respect other antibiotics. The adjuvant properties of IT could be used to combat bacterial biofilm and/or to improve antibiotic treatment. Moreover because the production of EV represents a secretory pathway involved in intercellular communication shared to mammalian cells, fungi, and bacteria, our study is important to increase information that can be generalized to higher organisms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.

The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria have been traditionally used to evaluate the presence of sepsis; however, recent evidence questions its predictive value due to its low sensitivity and specificity. In 2016, new criteria for sepsis were published and a new tool emerged, quick SOFA (qSOFA), for the rapid evaluation of infection in emergency services.\nObjective: To compare the qSOFA and SRIS tools for the prediction of bacteremia caused by S. aureus.\nMaterials and methods: We conducted an observational study in patients with S. aureus bacteremia to evaluate their phenotypic resistance patterns, some special features (sociodemographic characteristics, clinical and paraclinical values), complications, and mortality.

However, treatment options for patients are quickly exhausted when these medications are not desired, tolerated, or beneficial. As an example, we discuss the case of a man who was hospitalized 27 times over 2\u00a0years for complications related to his opioid use disorder (OUD), including recurring methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus vertebral osteomyelitis, increasing antimicrobial resistance, new infections, and multiple overdoses in and out of the hospital. The patient suffered these complications despite efforts to treat his OUD with methadone and buprenorphine while hospitalized, and repeated attempts to link him to outpatient care. We use this case to review evidence-based treatments for refractory OUD, which are not approved in the US, but are available in Canada. If hospitalized in Vancouver, Canada, this patient could have been offered slow-release oral morphine and injectable opioid agonist therapy, as well as access to sterile syringes and injection equipment at an in-hospital supervised injection facility. Each of these approaches is supported by evidence and has been implemented successfully in Canada, yet none are available in the US.

Despite current advances in antimicrobial chemotherapy, the infections caused by S. aureus remain challenging due to their ability to readily develop resistance. Indeed, antibiotic resistance, exemplified by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a top threat to global health security. Furthermore, the current rate of antibiotic discovery is much slower than the rate of antibiotic-resistance development. It seems evident that the conventional in vitro bacterial growth-based screening strategies can no longer effectively supply new antibiotics at the rate needed to combat bacterial antibiotic-resistance. To overcome this antibiotic resistance crisis, screening assays based on host-pathogen interactions have been developed. In particular, the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been used for drug screening against MRSA. In this review, we will discuss the general principles of the C. elegans-based screening platform and will highlight its unique strengths by comparing it with conventional antibiotic screening platforms. We will outline major hits from high-throughput screens of more than 100,000 small molecules using the C. elegans-MRSA infection assay and will review the mode-of-action of the identified hit compounds.

K. oxytoca DSM 29614 was cultivated in a defined growth medium-containing citrate (as sole carbon source) and supplemented with Ag<sup>+</sup> and either low or high Fe(III) concentration. As inferred from elemental analysis, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and dynamic light scattering, Ag-EPS NPs were produced in both conditions and contained also Fe. The production yield of high-Fe/Ag-EPS NPs was 12 times higher than the production yield of low-Fe/Ag-EPS NPs, confirming the stimulatory effect of iron. However, relative Ag content and Ag<sup>+</sup> ion release were higher in low-Fe/Ag-EPS NPs than in high-Fe/Ag-EPS NPs, as revealed by emission-excitation spectra by luminescent spectrometry using a novel ad hoc established phycoerythrin fluorescence-based assay. Interestingly, high and low-Fe/Ag-EPS NPs showed different and growth medium-dependent minimal inhibitory concentrations against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442.

non-healing chronic diabetic wounds. The dataset presented here is in support of the development and evaluation of the exosome laden oxygen releasing OxOBand for treatment and management of diabetic and infectious wounds [1]. It describes the additional results in support of the development of OxOBand and its evaluation for diabetic wound healing. Exosomes were isolated from adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and characterized through dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The encapsulation of exosomes by cells and its effect on migration of NIH3T3 cells under in-vitro condition is described. Further antioxidant polyurethane (PUAO) cryogel and oxygen releasing antioxidant (PUAO-CPO) cryogel scaffolds were fabricated as reported earlier [2,3] and NIH3T3, HaCaT and ADSCs were cultured on these scaffolds. \"OxOBand\", the calcium peroxide containing oxygen releasing antioxidant polyurethane (PUAO-CPO) scaffold along with exosomes was evaluated in chronic wounds in diabetic rats. The wounds were also infected with <i>Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa)</i> bacteria and OxOBand was further evaluated for the healing of these infectious diabetic wounds.

A head CT and an ultrasound of the neck revealed septated complex fluid collection surrounding the shunt. Therapy was initiated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone. Blood and CSF cultures from hospital day (HD) 1 were positive for methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> with a CPT MIC of 0.5 mg/L and a vancomycin MIC range of 0.5 to 1 mg/L. On HD 3, CPT was added. On HD 7, simultaneous serum (69.4, 44, and 30.2 mg/L) and CSF (1.7, 2.3, and 2.3 mg/L) concentrations were obtained at 0.25, 1.5, and 4.75 hours from the end of an infusion.

The research performed at the time, and for the first time, exposed the American public as well as the biomedical community, in a major way, to understanding disease progression and investigation. Those studies led to the identification of the cause, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and the pyrogenic toxin superantigen TSS toxin 1 (TSST-1), and many of the risk factors, for example, tampon use. Those studies in turn led to TSS warning labels on the outside and inside of tampon boxes and, as important, uniform standards worldwide of tampon absorbency labeling. This review addresses our understanding of the development and conclusions related to mTSS and risk factors. We leave the final message that even though mTSS is not commonly in the news today, cases continue to occur. Additionally, <i>S. aureus</i> strains cycle in human populations in roughly 10-year intervals, possibly dependent on immune status. TSST-1-producing <i>S. aureus</i> bacteria appear to be reemerging, suggesting that physician awareness of this emergence and mTSS history should be heightened."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 American Society for Microbiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA Patrick-schlievert@uiowa.edu."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schlievert", "ForeName": "Patrick M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Creighton University, Omaha, Nebraska, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davis", "ForeName": "Catherine C", "Initials": "CC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Clin Microbiol Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "8807282", "ISSNLinking": "0893-8512"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32461307", "33/3/e00032-19", "10.1128/CMR.00032-19"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [["Cardiac arrest", "Insulin infusion by external pump", "Septic shock", "Staphylococcus aureus"]], "PMID": "32461155", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "06", "Day": "02"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "24"}], "ELocationID": ["S1262-3636(20)30084-7", "10.1016/j.diabet.2020.05.007"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1878-1780", "JournalIssue": {"PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "May", "Day": "24"}}, "Title": "Diabetes & metabolism", "ISOAbbreviation": "Diabetes Metab."}, "ArticleTitle": "Septic shock with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus secondary to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion by external pump.", "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Diabetology, Endocrinology and Nutrition Department, Paris Saint-Joseph Hospital, 75014 Paris, France.

After 5 weeks, the bone healing process was evaluated, and revision surgery was performed in order to obtain increased bone healing. The initial K-wires were removed, and debridement of the osteotomy-gap was done followed by a more stable re-osteosynthesis with an angle-stable plate.

A total of 658 samples were collected from individual pigs (n\u00a0=\u00a0618) and the piggery environment (n\u00a0=\u00a040), distributed amongst five different pig age groups. Presumptive MRSA isolates were confirmed by the presence of mecA, and MALDI-TOF was performed for species verification. All isolates were tested against 18 different antimicrobials. MRSA was isolated from 75.2% (95% CI 71.8-78.6) of samples collected from pigs, and 71% of the MRSA isolates from this source were identified as community-associated (CA)-MRSA ST93, while the remainder were livestock-associated (LA)-MRSA ST398. Amongst environmental isolates, 80% (CI 64.3-95.7) were ST93 and the remainder ST398. All MRSA isolates from pigs and the environment were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, linezolid, mupirocin, rifampicin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, teicoplanin and vancomycin. Phenotypic rates of resistance were penicillin (100%), clindamycin (97.6%), erythromycin (96.3%), ceftiofur (93.7%), chloramphenicol (81.2%), tetracycline (63.1%) and amoxicillin-clavulanate (63.9%). A low prevalence of resistance (9.2%) was observed against neomycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin. The probability of MRSA carriage in dry sows (42.2%) was found to be significantly lower (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) when compared to other age groups: farrowing sows (76.8%, RR1.82), weaners (97.8%, RR 2.32), growers (94.2%, RR 2.23) and finishers (98.3%, RR 2.33). Amongst different production age groups, a significant difference was also found in antimicrobial resistance for amoxicillin-clavulanate, neomycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Using the RT-PCR assay adopted in this study, filtering of highly prevalent ST93 and non-ST93 isolates was performed at high throughput and low cost. In conclusion, this study found that weaner pigs presented a higher risk for CA-MRSA and antimicrobial resistance compared to other age groups.

Due to this reason, one of the essential aspects of food safety focuses on bacterial adaptation and proliferation under preservative conditions. This study was aimed to determine the metabolic changes that can occur following the exposure of <i>S. aureus</i> to either low temperature conditions or elevated concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl). The results revealed that most of the metabolites measured were reduced in cold-stressed cells, when compared to reference controls. The major reduction was observed in nucleotides and organic acids, whereas mannitol was significantly increased in response to low temperature. However, when <i>S. aureus</i> was exposed to elevated NaCl, a significant increase was observed in the metabolite levels, particularly purine and pyrimidine bases along with organic acids. The majority of carbohydrates remained constant in the cells grown under ideal conditions and those exposed to elevated NaCl concentrations. Partial least square discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) of the metabolomic data indicated that both, prolonged cold stress and osmotic stress conditions, generated cells with different metabolic profiles, in comparison to the reference controls. These results provide evidence that, when bacterial cells exposed to low temperatures or high concentrations of NaCl, experience <i>in situ</i> homeostatic alterations to adapt to new environmental conditions. These data supported the hypothesis that changes in metabolic homeostasis were critical to the adaptive processes required for survival under alterations in the environmental conditions."],

Based on this factor, a new type of spherical cinnamon nanoclusters (Cin-NCs) were synthesised using eco-friendly nanosecond pulse laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) approach. As-grown nontoxic Cin-NCs suspended in the citric acid of pH 4.5 (acted as organic solvent) were characterised thoroughly to evaluate their structural, optical and bactericidal properties. The effects of various laser fluences (LF) at the fixed wavelength (532\u00a0nm) on the physiochemical properties of these Cin-NCs were determined. The FTIR spectra of the Cin-NCs displayed the symmetric-asymmetric stretching of the functional groups attached to the heterocyclic/cinnamaldehyde compounds. The HR-TEM image of the optimum sample revealed the nucleation of the crystalline spherical Cin-NCs with a mean diameter of approximately 10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0nm and lattice fringe spacing around 0.14\u00a0nm.

However, the SCCmec in this MRSL strain, with three ccr complexes, was structurally unique and currently untypable. Moreover, the SCCmec of this MRSL strain was found to carry two genes encoding microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMM)-like proteins accompanied by glycosyl transferases, one of which may have been derived from S. aureus and the other from S. epidermidis, indicating that this MRSL evolved to carry virulence factors from other staphylococci.

Teixobactin against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus: an Untargeted Metabolomics Study.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Antibiotics have served humankind through their use in modern medicine as effective treatments for otherwise fatal bacterial infections. Teixobactin is a first member of newly discovered natural antibiotics that was recently identified from a hitherto-unculturable soil bacterium, <i>Eleftheria terrae</i>, and recognized as a potent antibacterial agent against various Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. The most distinctive characteristic of teixobactin as an effective antibiotic is that teixobactin resistance could not be evolved in a laboratory setting. It is purported that teixobactin's \"resistance-resistant\" mechanism of action includes binding to the essential bacterial cell wall synthesis building blocks lipid II and lipid III. In the present study, metabolomics was used to investigate the potential metabolic pathways involved in the mechanisms of antibacterial activity of the synthetic teixobactin analogue Leu<sub>10</sub>-teixobactin against a MRSA strain, <i>S. aureus</i> ATCC 700699. The metabolomes of <i>S. aureus</i> ATCC 700699 cells 1, 3, and 6 h following treatment with Leu<sub>10</sub>-teixobactin (0.5 \u03bcg/ml, i.e., 0.5\u00d7\u2009MIC) were compared to those of the untreated controls. Leu<sub>10</sub>-teixobactin significantly perturbed bacterial membrane lipids (glycerophospholipids and fatty acids), peptidoglycan (lipid I and II) metabolism, and cell wall teichoic acid (lipid III) biosynthesis as early as after 1 h of treatment, reflecting an initial activity on the cell envelope. Concordant with its time-dependent antibacterial killing action, Leu<sub>10</sub>-teixobactin caused more perturbations in the levels of key intermediates in pathways of amino-sugar and nucleotide-sugar metabolism and their downstream peptidoglycan and teichoic acid biosynthesis at 3 and 6 h. Significant perturbations in arginine metabolism and the interrelated tricarboxylic acid cycle, histidine metabolism, pantothenate, and coenzyme A biosynthesis were also observed at 3 and 6 h. To conclude, this is the first study to provide novel metabolomics mechanistic information, which lends support to the development of teixobactin as an antibacterial drug for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive infections.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest threats to the global health system. It is imperative that new anti-infective therapeutics be developed against problematic \"superbugs.\" The cyclic depsipeptide teixobactin holds much promise as a new class of antibiotics for highly resistant Gram-positive pathogens (e.g., methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> [MRSA]). Understanding its molecular mechanism(s) of action could lead to the design of new compounds with a broader activity spectrum. Here, we describe the first metabolomics study to investigate the killing mechanism(s) of teixobactin against MRSA. Our findings revealed that teixobactin significantly disorganized the bacterial cell envelope, as reflected by a profound perturbation in the bacterial membrane lipids and cell wall biosynthesis (peptidoglycan and teichoic acid). Importantly, teixobactin significantly suppressed the main intermediate d-alanyl-d-lactate involved in the mechanism of vancomycin resistance in <i>S. aureus</i> These novel results help explain the unique mechanism of action of teixobactin and its lack of cross-resistance with vancomycin."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Hussein et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo":

This work demonstrates the effects of an incremental increase of nanopillar height on nanostructure-induced bacterial cell death. We propose that the mechanical lysis of bacterial cells can be influenced by the degree of elasticity and clustering of highly ordered silicon nanopillar arrays. Herein, silicon nanopillar arrays with diameter 35 nm, periodicity 90 nm and increasing heights of 220, 360, and 420 nm were fabricated using deep UV immersion lithography. Nanoarrays of 360-nm-height pillars exhibited the highest degree of bactericidal activity toward both Gram stain-negative <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and Gram stain-positive <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> bacteria, inducing 95 \u00b1 5% and 83 \u00b1 12% cell death, respectively. At heights of 360 nm, increased nanopillar elasticity contributes to the onset of pillar deformation in response to bacterial adhesion to the surface. Theoretical analyses of pillar elasticity confirm that deflection, deformation force, and mechanical energies are more significant for the substrata possessing more flexible pillars. Increased storage and release of mechanical energy may explain the enhanced bactericidal action of these nanopillar arrays toward bacterial cells contacting the surface; however, with further increase of nanopillar height (420 nm), the forces (and tensions) can be partially compensated by irreversible interpillar adhesion that reduces their bactericidal effect. These findings can be used to inform the design of next-generation mechano-responsive surfaces with tuneable bactericidal characteristics for antimicrobial surface technologies."]}, "AuthorList":

Intriguingly, in <i>Staphylococcus aureus,</i> a peptide similar to cAM373, named cAM373_SA, is produced from the <i>camS</i> gene. Here, we report that the staphylococcal Eep homolog is not only responsible for the production of cAM373_SA but also critical for staphylococcal virulence. As with other Eep proteins, the staphylococcal Eep protein has four transmembrane domain (TM) with the predicted zinc metalloprotease active site (HExxH) in the first TM. The <i>eep</i> deletion reduced the cAM373_SA activity in the culture supernatant to the level of the <i>camS</i> deletion mutant. It also markedly decreased the cAM373 peptide peak in an HPLC analysis. Proteomics analysis showed that Eep affects the production and/or the release of diverse proteins including the signal peptidase subunit SpsB and the surface proteins SpA, SasG, and FnbA. The <i>eep</i>-deletion decreased the adherence of <i>S. aureus</i> to host epithelial cells; however, the adherence of the <i>eep</i> mutant was increased by overexpression of the surface proteins SpA, SasG and FnbA. The <i>eep</i>-deletion reduced the staphylococcal resistance to the killing by human neutrophils as well as the survival in a murine model of blood infection. The overexpression of the surface protein SpA in the <i>eep</i> mutant increased the bacterial survival in the liver. Our study illustrates that, in <i>S. aureus</i>, Eep not only generates cAM373_SA, but also contributes to the survival of the bacterial pathogen in the host.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The emergence of multi-drug resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> makes the treatment of staphylococcal infections much more difficult. <i>S. aureus</i> can acquire a drug-resistance gene from other bacteria, such as <i>Enterococcus faecali</i>s. Intriguingly, <i>S. aureus</i> produces a sex pheromone for the <i>E. faecalis</i> plasmid pAM373, raising the possibility that <i>S. aureus</i> might actively promote plasmid conjugation from <i>E. faecalis.</i> In this study, we found that the staphylococcal Eep protein is responsible for the sex pheromone processing and contributes to the survival of the bacteria in the host. These results will enhance future research on the drug resistance acquisition of <i>S. aureus</i> and can lead to the development of novel anti-virulence drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 American Society for Microbiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Danhong", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Huiying", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Analytical Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Sen", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": ["https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8897-5117"], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiaoyun", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine-Northwest, Gary, IN, USA."}], "Identifier": ["https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0576-2851"], "LastName": "Bae", "ForeName": "Taeok", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. ruth_limin@126.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. qq2005011@163.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Bacteriol", "NlmUniqueID": "2985120R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9193"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["32457050", "JB.00046-20", "10.1128/JB.00046-20"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [["Antimicrobial resistance", "Bacterial mastitis pathogens", "Dairy cattle", "Minimum inhibitory concentrations", "Surveillance"]], "PMID": "32456822", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "27"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "11"}], "ELocationID": ["S0378-1135(19)31229-5", "10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.108644"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1873-2542", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "245", "PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "Jun"}}, "Title": "Veterinary microbiology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Vet.

For Klebsiella spp. (n\u202f=\u202f70), similar results were noted, except for ampicillin and kanamycin. We detected 3.7 % (11/295) Enterobacteriaceae isolates carrying an ESBL/AmpC gene. Staphylococcus aureus (n\u202f=\u202f247) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; n\u202f=\u202f189) isolates were susceptible to most antimicrobials tested except to penicillin (25.1 and 29.1 % resistance).

CoNS isolates were selected on the basis of their antibiotic susceptibility profiles and their biofilm-associated behavior. In this context, a total of 29 different bacteriophages were isolated and, in particular, lytic phages (6 isolates) were selected. The host range and physiological parameters of the lytic phages have been studied. Electron microscopy images showed that lytic phages were members of the families <i>Myoviridae</i> (CoNShP-1, CoNShP-3, and CoNSeP-2 isolates) and <i>Siphoviridae</i> (CoNShP-2, CoNSsP-1, and CoNSeP-1 isolates).

Indeed, CoNShP-3 phage showed an antibiofilm effect against <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i> CFS79 and <i>Staphylococcus haemolyticus</i> CFS43, respectively, while <i>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</i> CFS28 biofilm was completely removed. Finally, CoNShP-3 phage demonstrated a high preservative efficacy over short and long periods of storage against inoculated CoNS in chicken breast sections.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed the surface morphology of bare PLA and PLA@Ag retractor, revealing a homogeneous and full surface coverage of Ag NPs. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated the crystallinity of Ag nanocoating. Ultraviolent-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) highlighted the AgNP plasmonic optical responses and average particle size of 31.08 \u00b1 6.68 nm. TEM images of the PLA@Ag crossection demonstrated the thickness of the deposited Ag nanolayer, as well as an observed tendency of AgNPs to penetrate though the outer surface of PLA.

Over a 2-year period, all patients undergoing prosthesis revision were included in the study. A C-reactive protein assay and a serological test specifically designed against 5 bacterial species (<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>S. epidermidis</i>, <i>S. lugdunensis, Streptococcus agalactiae</i>, <i>Cutibacterium acnes</i>) were performed preoperatively. Five samples per patient were taken intraoperatively during surgery. The diagnosis of PJI was based on clinical and bacteriological criteria according to guidelines. <b>Results:</b> Between November 2015 and November 2017, 115 patients were included, 49 for a chronic PJI and 66 for a mechanical problem. Among patients with PJI, a sinus tract was observed in 32.6% and a C-reactive protein level \u226510 mg/L in 74.5%.

Another aim was to evaluate <i>E. faecalis</i> gelE gene expression during biofilm formation.", "Firstly, crystal violet staining was used to measure the total biofilm biomass of the isolates. Secondly, plate counting was performed to determine the biofilm formation ability of <i>E. faecalis</i> isolates and the effect of <i>S. aureus</i> on <i>E. faecalis</i> biofilm formation. Finally, the gelE expression profile of the isolates was assessed by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction.", "According to crystal violet staining and plate counting, all <i>E. faecalis</i> isolates were biofilm producers and the number of <i>E. faecalis</i> sessile cells increased in the presence of <i>S. aureus</i>.

Western blot analysis of 2DG treated cells showed downregulation of bacterial-induced MEK/ERK pathways. In vivo, intravitreal administration of 2DG both pre- and post-bacterial infection resulted in a significant reduction in intraocular inflammation in C57BL/6 mouse eyes and downregulation of ERK phosphorylation in retinal tissue.

The ability of S.\u00a0aureus to survive and replicate within phagocytes such as macrophages represents an important facet of immune evasion and contributes to pathogenesis. The mechanisms by which S.\u00a0aureus acquires nutrients within host cells to support growth remain poorly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that macrophages infected with S.\u00a0aureus maintain their dynamic ruffling behavior and consume macromolecules from the extracellular milieu. To support the notion that fluid-phase uptake by macrophages can provide S.\u00a0aureus with nutrients, we utilized the pharmacological inhibitors PIK-III and Dynasore to impair uptake of extracellular macromolecules. Inhibitor treatment also impaired S.\u00a0aureus replication within macrophages. Finally, using a mutant of S.\u00a0aureus that is defective in purine biosynthesis we show that intracellular growth is inhibited unless the macrophage culture medium is supplemented with the metabolite inosine monophosphate. This growth rescue can be impaired by inhibition of fluid-phase uptake. In summary, through consumption of the extracellular environment macrophages deliver nutrients to phagolysosomal S.\u00a0aureus to promote bacterial growth."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 The Authors."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada."}], "Identifier": ["https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3263-2227"], "LastName": "Flannagan", "ForeName": "Ronald S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada."}], "Identifier": ["https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7217-2456"], "LastName": "Heinrichs", "ForeName": "David E", "Initials": "DE"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "488865", "Agency": "Cystic Fibrosis Canada (Fibrose kystique Canada)", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "EMBO Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "100963049", "ISSNLinking": "1469-221X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Lakhundi S, Zhang K (2018) Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus : molecular characterization, evolution, and epidemiology.

This study examined the presence of MRSA in 400 samples comprising 200 raw milks (145 from goat and 55 from sheep) and 200 nasal swabs (145 from goats and 55 from sheep) collected from ten different locations in Abeokuta, Nigeria. Samples were examined using standard bacteriological methods for the isolation and identification of Staphylococcus aureus and culture on oxacillin (6\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and cefoxitin (2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) selective media for the detection of MRSA. Suspected MRSA isolates were confirmed by latex agglutination test for the detection of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was determined by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. Staphylococcus aureus was detected in 72 (18%) of 400 samples of which 52 (13%) were confirmed as MRSA. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was detected in raw milk (37 of 200; 18.5%) and nasal swab (15 of 200; 7.5%). There was no significance difference (p\u2009>\u20090.05) in the prevalence of MRSA in sheep (37.7%) and goat (23.4%). The MRSA isolates showed resistance to ampicillin (100%), cloxacillin (100%), sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim (100%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (84.6%), ceftriaxone (75%), cefuroxime (69.2%), erythromycin (65.4%), streptomycin (38.5%), ciprofloxacin (23.1%), pefloxacin (21.2%) and gentamicin (17.3%). The presence of multidrug-resistant MRSA in small ruminants reared in Abeokuta metropolis may be due to regular use of antibiotics and unhygienic practices by farmers.

Herein, inspired by the proteolytic activity of S. aureus protease on a specific peptide substrate, we developed a rapid, simple and cost-effective biosensor for S. aureus using dual colorimetric and electrochemical detection on the same platform. In this approach, gold screen printed electrodes were used on which specific peptide sequences coupled to magnetic nanoparticles were immobilized giving the black color of the sensor surface. The addition of the S. aureus protease solution on the electrode surface causes cleavage of the peptide sequence and the release of the magnetic nanoparticles revealing the golden colour of the electrode which can be easily seen by the naked eye. Furthermore, square wave voltammetric signals can be detected on the same electrode in the ferro/ferricyanide redox couple. The change in the peak current after peptide cleavage was directly proportional to the concentration of S. aureus. The detection limit of the electrochemical assay was 3 CFU ml-1 after 1 min. Moreover, the biosensor was capable of specifically distinguishing S. aureus from other food- and water-borne bacteria such as E. coli and Listeria using the dual mode colorimetric and electrochemical detection. The biosensor was also tested in spiked milk and water samples showing very good recovery percentages. Thus, we believe that this dual mode biosensing platform enables the easy and accurate determination of S. aureus and holds great promise for point-of-care diagnosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Alfaisal University, Al Zahrawi Street, Al Maather, Al Takhassusi Road, Riyadh 11533, Saudi Arabia. mzourob@alfaisal.edu."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5558-0060"], "LastName": "Eissa", "ForeName": "Shimaa", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Alfaisal University, Al Zahrawi Street, Al Maather, Al Takhassusi Road, Riyadh 11533, Saudi Arabia. mzourob@alfaisal.edu and King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Zahrawi Street, Al Maather, Riyadh 12713, Saudi Arabia."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2187-1430"], "LastName": "Zourob", "ForeName": "Mohammed", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Analyst", "NlmUniqueID": "0372652", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2654"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["32451524", "10.1039/d0an00673d"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [], "PMID": "32451472", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "26"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "25"}], "ELocationID": ["10.1038/s41564-020-0729-6"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "2058-5276", "JournalIssue": {"PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "May", "Day": "25"}}, "Title": "Nature microbiology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Nat Microbiol"}, "ArticleTitle": "Prokaryotic single-cell RNA sequencing by in situ combinatorial indexing.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Despite longstanding appreciation of gene expression heterogeneity in isogenic bacterial populations, affordable and scalable technologies for studying single bacterial cells have been limited.

Here, we present prokaryotic expression profiling by tagging RNA in situ and sequencing (PETRI-seq)-a low-cost, high-throughput prokaryotic scRNA-seq pipeline that overcomes these technical obstacles. PETRI-seq uses in situ combinatorial indexing<sup>11,12,18</sup> to barcode transcripts from tens of thousands of cells in a single experiment. PETRI-seq captures single-cell transcriptomes of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria with high purity and low bias, with median capture rates of more than 200 mRNAs per cell for exponentially growing Escherichia coli. These characteristics enable robust discrimination of cell states corresponding to different phases of growth. When applied to wild-type Staphylococcus aureus, PETRI-seq revealed a rare subpopulation of cells undergoing prophage induction.

To investigate whether S. aureus viability influences EV biogenesis, EVs were isolated from human neutrophils incubated with viable bacteria (bEVs) or heat-killed bacteria (heat-killed EVs). Protein analysis, nanoparticle tracking and transmission electron microscopy showed comparable EV production between subsets, and both viable and nonviable bacteria were also detected in respective EV subsets. As anticipated, S. aureus, as well as bEVs with viable bacteria, were proinflammatory, and killing bacteria with gentamicin reduced cytokine production to baseline levels. Although heat-killed bacteria induced macrophage IL-6 production, heat-killed EVs did not. Additionally, we found that human and bacterial DNA associated with bEVs, but not heat-killed EVs, and that the DNA association could be partially decreased by disrupting electrostatic interactions. We investigated the potential for DNA isolated from EVs (EV-DNA) or EVs to cause inflammation. Although liposomal encapsulation of EV-DNA increased IL-6 production from baseline by 7.5-fold, treatment of bEVs with DNase I had no effect on IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 production, suggesting that the DNA did not contribute to the inflammatory response. Filtered EVs, which lacked DNA and associated bacteria, exhibited less proinflammatory activity relative to bEVs, and enhanced macrophage expression of CD86 and HLA-DR. Ultimately, we show that bEVs isolated by differential centrifugation co-purify with bacteria and DNA, and studying their concerted activity and relative contribution to immune response is important to the study of host-pathogen interactions."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a92020 Society for Leukocyte Biology."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Allen", "ForeName": "Edwina R", "Initials": "ER"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cancer Biology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lempke", "ForeName": "Samantha L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "Michaela M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bush", "ForeName": "Delaney M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Braswell", "ForeName": "Brandyn G", "Initials": "BG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Estes", "ForeName": "Casey L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Benedict", "ForeName": "Everett L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mahon", "ForeName": "Andrew R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sabo", "ForeName": "Shasta L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA."}], "Identifier": ["https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9893-7309"], "LastName": "Greenlee-Wacker", "ForeName": "Mallary C", "Initials": "MC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Leukoc Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8405628", "ISSNLinking": "0741-5400"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Hassoun A, Linden PK, Friedman B.

Livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) is defined as MRSA possessing staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) IV or V, both of which lacks the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene but has variable combinations of antimicrobial susceptibility. This study focused on Taiwan's subtropical river basin and the Puzih River, which converges from tributaries flowing through downtown and animal husbandry areas. MRSA was detected at a rate of 7.8% in the tributaries, which was higher than downstream (2.1%). The ratio of multidrug-resistant (MDR) MRSA (n\u00a0=\u00a030) to total MRSA isolates (n\u00a0=\u00a039) was 0.769, and most of the MDR MRSA isolates (66.7%, 20/30) exhibited resistance to chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and tetracycline. The number of MDR MRSA isolates in the tributaries was also higher than the downstream regions of the Puzih River. The majority of MRSA isolates (64.1%) observed in this study possessed SCCmec type IV without PVL, which is typical for LA-MRSA. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR (ERIC-PCR) typing aided the discrimination of resistance patterns among SCCmec types. This study highlights the threat to human health posed by the waterborne transmission of MDR LA-MRSA."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Exfoliative toxins (ETs) are one of the important virulence factors that participating in staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Melittin has different biological activities, comprising of antiviral, broad spectrum antibacterial, antiprotozoal, antifungal and anti-inflammatory effects. Twelve clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) were obtained from wound infection in the burn patients. The MIC plus three sub-inhibitory concentrations (I, II and III) of clindamycin and melittin were tested. Next, the synergistic effects of melittin and clindamycin were evaluated using the broth microdilution checkerboard assay. The detection of exfoliative toxin A and B genes were examined by PCR method. Then the effects of sub-MIC melittin on the expression levels of eta and etb were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. Melittin MIC values against MRSA and MSSA planktonic cells were 0.25-0.5 and 0.25-1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, respectively. The clindamycin MIC values against MRSA and MSSA were between 0.5 and 8\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and 0.5-2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, respectively. The results of the time-kill kinetics assay (3.5log<sub>10</sub> and 3log<sub>10</sub>) against MSSA and MRSA planktonic cells were determined within 24\u00a0h using melittin. The mean expression of eta in MRSA and MSSA was significantly downregulated to approximately 3.5 and 4 fold, respectively. Moreover, the mean expression of etb in MRSA and MSSA were significantly downregulated to approximately 2.5 and 3 fold, respectively. Hemolytic assay showed that the extracted melittin indicates a strong hemolytic activity (HD<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0\u03bcg/ml). Melittin at 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml induced cell lysis and stimulated the formation of vesicles in S. aureus strains. Melittin could reduce the expression of eta and etb as encoding exfoliative toxin A and B genes. This component appears to be a good candidate for the treatment of MRSA and MSSA strains. So, melittin in combination with clindamycin can be classified as a complementary treatment of wound infections in burn patients."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.

S. xylosus and S. aureus are both capable of forming a biofilm and share the same ecological niches, thus we explored their interaction in biofilms with a view to limiting the risks associated with S. aureus. Cell-free supernatants of different strains of S. xylosus were able to inhibit the biofilm formation of S. aureus. The S. xylosus C2a strain released into the supernatant a molecule of molecular weight above 30\u00a0kDa that is resistant to proteolytic enzymes and inhibits the formation of S. aureus MW2 biofilm, though the mechanism involved has yet to be elucidated. Furthermore, S. xylosus C2a modified the architecture of S. aureus MW2 in co-culture biofilm. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that S. aureus formed a biofilm with a flat and compact structure while in co-culture with S. xylosus the two species formed large juxtaposed aggregates throughout the period of incubation. This architecture made the S. aureus biofilm more susceptible to detachment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, due its relatively low mechanical properties and water solubility, many inorganic compounds (e.g., bioactive glasses [BGs]) have been used in combination with zein to obtain composite materials with improved mechanical properties. Such inorganic additions provide further biological functionality to zein. In this work, fiber mats of zein with incorporation of BG and copper doped BG particles are successfully obtained by electrospinning. At first the electrospinnability of the blends is assessed, then the morphological and chemical characterization of the mats is done. Degradation study in cell culture medium (Dubelcco's modified Eagle's medium) reveals a sufficient strength of the fibers, which in turn is necessary for in vitro cellular studies. Cell culture studies using MG-63 and C2C12 cells show promising results, demonstrating increased cell proliferation and growth for fiber mats containing both types of BGs. Also, evaluation with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria confirms the antibacterial activity of the scaffolds containing copper.

In our previous study, we found that synthetic salusin-\u03b2 exhibits antibacterial activity against only Gram-positive microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus NBRC 12732. Salusin-\u03b2 has an ability to depolarize the cytoplasmic membrane of this bacterium, and this phenomenon may be linked to the antibacterial activity of this peptide. A cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) (49-57) is a short cationic peptide that can traverse cell membranes. In this report, synthetic peptide conjugates of salusin-\u03b2 and HIV-1 Tat (49-57) showed potent antibacterial activities against both Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus NBRC 12732 and Gram-negative Escherichia coli NBRC 12734. The synthetic peptides also depolarized the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli NBRC 12734 as well as Staphylococcus aureus NBRC 12732. These results suggested that HIV-1 Tat (49-57) is a protein transduction domain or CPP that changes the interaction mode between salusin-\u03b2 and the cell membrane of Escherichia coli NBRC 12734.

of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity, antibiotic-associated synergy, and anti-biofilm activity of the ruthenium complex, <i>cis</i>-[RuCl<sub>2</sub> (dppb) (bqdi)]<sup>2+</sup> (RuNN). RuNN exhibited antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 15.6 to 62.5\u2009\u00b5g ml<sup>-1</sup> and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values ranging from 62.5 to 125\u2009\u00b5g ml<sup>-1</sup>. A synergistic effect against <i>Staphylococcus</i> spp. was observed when RuNN was combined with ampicillin, and the range of associated fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values was 0.187 to 0.312.

The objective of this study was to identify and isolate lactic acid bacterial (LAB) strains from the intestinal tracts of pigs and feces of dogs and then characterize them as potential probiotics with antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria. In a preliminary isolation screening, 45 of 1167 isolated LAB strains were found to have anti-S. aureus ATCC 27,735 activity. Using 16S rDNA and 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region (ISR) sequences, five of these isolates were further identified as Lactobacillus animalis 30a-2, Lactobacillus reuteri 4-12E, Weissella cibaria C34, Lactococcus lactis 5-12H, and Lactococcus lactis 6-3H. Antimicrobial substance assays suggest that the L. lactis 5-12H, L. lactis 6-3H, L. animalis 30a-2, L. reuteri 4-12E, and W. cibaria C34 strains might produce bacteriocins and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) as antimicrobial substances. The L. animalis 30a-2 and W. cibaria C34 strains were further characterized for probiotic properties and shown to have high acid and bile salt tolerance. Additionally, they have broad antimicrobial spectra, and can significantly repress the growth of all of the tested strains of MRSA isolates, some MDRAB, ESBL E. coli, and P. aeruginosa isolates, along with food-borne pathogenic bacteria such as Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Listeria monocytogens ATCC 19111, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Yersinia enterocolitica BCRC 12986. This is the first report of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-producing L. animalis 30a-2 and W. cibaria C34 isolated from the intestinal tracts of pigs and feces of dogs that have good antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant and food-borne pathogenic bacteria and have excellent probiotic properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, National Chiayi University, Chiayi, Taiwan. cflin@mail.ncyu.edu.tw."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Chuen-Fu", "Initials": "CF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Biotechnology, Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taichung, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Meng-Yi", "Initials": "MY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Pingtung, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Chao-Nan", "Initials": "CN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Pingtung, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiou", "ForeName": "Ming-Tang", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, Feng Yuan Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taichung, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jia-Wen", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Entomology, College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Kai-Chieh", "Initials": "KC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Entomology, College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan. mcwu@nchu.edu.tw."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1837-6826"], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ming-Cheng", "Initials": "MC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Arch Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0410427", "ISSNLinking": "0302-8933"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "01", "Day": "08"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "04", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["32447432", "10.1007/s00203-020-01908-w", "10.1007/s00203-020-01908-w"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [["Antibacterial", "Broad-spectrum adsorption", "Nanoparticles", "Regeneration", "Superfast adsorption"]], "PMID": "32447020", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "06", "Day": "03"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "04"}], "ELocationID": ["S0021-9797(20)30595-6", "10.1016/j.jcis.2020.05.001"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1095-7103", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "576", "PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "May", "Day": "04"}}, "Title": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Colloid Interface Sci"}, "ArticleTitle": "One-pot fabrication of antibacterial \u03b2-cyclodextrin-based nanoparticles and their superfast, broad-spectrum adsorption towards pollutants.", "Pagination": {"MedlinePgn": "302-312"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["The current water treatment technology is still based on low energy efficient processes due to the complex composition of wastewater.

The resulting nanoparticles exhibited superfast adsorption kinetics to pollutants with removal efficiency of over 95% within 10\u00a0s. The nanoparticles also presented broad-spectrum adsorption to organic pollutants and heavy metal ions, and their maximum adsorption capacity was 3289.6\u00a0mg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> towards methyl orange (MO) and 970.8\u00a0mg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> towards Pb(II), much higher than that of many other adsorbents. Easy cyclic adsorption-desorption was another distinguishing feature of the nanoparticles, whose removal efficiency to these pollutants hardly varied after 10 cycles of regeneration. Interestingly, the resulting nanoparticles showed prominent antibacterial activity of 99.99% bacterial inhibitive rate against both gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) and gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus).

Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) combines the administration of a photosensitizer (PS) compound with low-irradiance light to induce photochemical reactions that yield reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since ROS react with nearly all biomolecules, aPDT offers a powerful multitarget method to avoid selection of drug-resistant strains. In this study, we assayed photodynamic inactivation under a standardized method, combining methylene blue (MB) as PS and red light, against global priority pathogens. The species tested include Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Our strain collection presents resistance to all tested antimicrobials (>50). All drug-resistant strains were compared to their drug-sensitive counterparts. Regardless of resistance phenotype, MB-aPDT presented species-specific dose-response kinetics. More than 5log<sub>10</sub> reduction was observed within less than 75\u00a0s of illumination for A. baumannii, E. coli, E. faecium, E. faecalis and S. aureus and within less than 7\u00a0min for K. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, C. albicans and C. neoformans. No signs of correlations in between drug-resistance profiles and aPDT sensitivity were observed. Therefore, MB-aPDT can provide effective therapeutic protocols for a very broad spectrum of pathogens.

The substances were synthesized from 2-hydroxy-quinones, lapachol and nor-lapachol, obtaining the corresponding 2-methoxylated derivatives via dimethyl sulfate alkylation in a basic medium, which then reacted chemoselectively with 2-ethanolamine and 3-propanolamine to form the corresponding amino alcohols. All three molecules underwent a virtual structure-based analysis (docking). The antibacterial activity of the substances was measured by determining their Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and a microdilution assay was performed to verify efflux pump inhibition using the substances at a sub-inhibitory concentration. The results were subjected to statistical analysis using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test. The substances obtained MIC values \u22651024\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, however, a significant reduction of their MICs was observed when the substances were associated with norfloxacin and ethidium bromide, with this effect being attributed to efflux pump inhibition.

Patients were enrolled in an institutional registry (tertiary academic medical center) for SAB or GNB. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded. Directed content analysis identified a priori and emergent themes. Theme matrix techniques were used to facilitate analysis and presentation.", "Interviews were completed with 30 SAB and 31 GNB patients. Most patients were at or near the end of intravenous antibiotic treatment when interviewed. We identified 3 primary high-level concepts: impact on QOL domains, time as a critical index, and sources of variability across patients. Across both types of bloodstream infection, the QOL domains most impacted were physical and functional, which was particularly evident among SAB patients.", "SAB/GNB impact QOL among survivors. In particular, SAB had major impacts on multiple QOL domains.

Prior efforts to discover a useful sortase inhibitor have relied upon an in vitro activity assay in which the enzyme is removed from its native site on the bacterial surface and truncated to improve solubility. To discover inhibitors that are effective in inactivating sortases in vivo, we developed and implemented a novel cell-based screen using Actinomyces oris, a key colonizer in the development of oral biofilms. A. oris is unique because it exhibits sortase-dependent growth in cell culture, providing a robust phenotype for high throughput screening (HTS). Three molecules representing two unique scaffolds were discovered by HTS and disrupt surface protein display in intact cells and inhibit enzyme activity in vitro. This represents the first HTS for sortase inhibitors that relies on the simple metric of cellular growth and suggests that A. oris may be a useful platform for discovery efforts targeting sortase."]},

In these diseases, <i>S. aureus</i> forms biofilms as cell aggregates interspersed in host matrix material. Here, we have observed that cell aggregation was significantly higher in the isogenic <i>spoVG</i>-deletion strain compared with that of the wild-type strain. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR data indicated that SpoVG could repress the expression of <i>sasC</i>, which codes for <i>S. aureus</i> surface protein C and is involved in cell aggregation and biofilm accumulation. Electromagnetic mobility shift assay demonstrated that SpoVG could specifically bind to the promoter region of <i>sasC</i>, indicating that SpoVG is a negative regulator and directly represses the expression of <i>sasC</i> In addition, deletion of the SasC aggregation domain in the <i>spoVG</i>-deletion strain indicated that high level expression of <i>sasC</i> could be the underlying cause of significantly increased cell aggregation formation. Our previous study has shown that SpoVG is involved in oxacillin resistance of methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> by regulating the expression of genes involved in cell wall synthesis and degradation. In this study, we also have found that SpoVG can negatively modulate the <i>S. aureus</i> drug tolerance under high concentration of oxacillin treatment. These findings can broaden our understanding of the regulation of biofilm formation and drug tolerance in <i>S. aureus</i><b>IMPORTANCE</b> This study has revealed that SpoVG can modulate cell aggregation by repressing <i>sasC</i> expression and eDNA release. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the potential linkage between cell aggregation and antibiotic resistance.

Many of these phages carry genes encoding toxins and other virulence factors. This phage, 80\u03b1, is also involved in high-frequency mobilization of <i>S. aureus</i> pathogenicity islands (SaPIs), mobile genetic elements that carry virulence factor genes. Bacteriophage 80\u03b1 encodes a minor capsid protein, gp44, between the genes for the portal protein and major capsid protein. Gp44 is essential for a productive infection by 80\u03b1 but not for transduction of SaPIs or plasmids. We previously demonstrated that gp44 is an ejection protein that acts to promote progression to the lytic cycle upon infection and suggested that the protein might act as an anti-repressor of CI in the lytic-lysogenic switch. However, an 80\u03b1 \u039444 mutant also exhibited a reduced rate of lysogeny. Here, we show that gp44 is a non-specific DNA binding protein with affinity for the blunt ends of linear DNA.

This situation has strongly stimulated a renewal of scientists' interest in bacteriophages (phages) since the beginning of the 21st century. Bacteriophages are the viruses of bacteria. They are abundant in nature, and accompany bacteria in each environment they colonize, including human microbiota. In this review, we focused on the use of bacteriophages as therapeutic agents to treat infections and reduce counts of pathogenic bacteria in poultry, as biocontrol agents to eliminate foodborne pathogens on/in food, and also as disinfectants to reduce contamination on food-contact surfaces or poultry carcasses in industrial conditions. Most of the phage-based products are targeted against the main foodborne pathogens, such as <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i>, <i>Salmonella</i> spp., <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus,</i> and <i>Clostridium perfringens</i>. Phages are currently addressed at all stages of the poultry production \"from farm to fork\", however, their implementation into live birds and food products still provokes discussions especially in the context of the current legal framework, limitations, as well as public health and safety."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Breeding, Institute of Animal Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences-SGGW, Ciszewskiego 8 St., 02-786 Warsaw, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "\u017bbikowska", "ForeName": "Katarzyna", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Breeding, Institute of Animal Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences-SGGW, Ciszewskiego 8 St., 02-786 Warsaw, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Michalczuk", "ForeName": "Monika", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Veterinary Diagnostics, Institute of Veterinary Medicine, Warsaw University of Life Sciences-SGGW, Nowoursynowska 159c St., 02-776 Warsaw, Poland."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-8836-5351"], "LastName": "Dolka", "ForeName": "Beata", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Animals (Basel)", "NlmUniqueID": "101635614", "ISSNLinking": "2076-2615"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "04", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32443410", "ani10050872", "10.3390/ani10050872"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": ["AIM", "IM"], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [], "PMID": "32443285", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "25"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": ["10.1097/MD.0000000000019617"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1536-5964", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "99", "Issue": "20", "PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "May"}}, "Title": "Medicine", "ISOAbbreviation": "Medicine (Baltimore)"}, "ArticleTitle": "Hematogenous osteomyelitis in childhood can relapse many years later into adulthood: A retrospective multicentric cohort study in France.", "Pagination": {"MedlinePgn": "e19617"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["To describe the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features and the management of adult patients who experienced a relapse between 2003 and 2015 of an acute hematogenous osteomyelitis acquired in childhood.A retrospective multicentric cohort study was conducted in 5 centers in France.Thirty-seven patients were included.

PBP2a's low affinity to most \u03b2-lactams, confers resistance to MRSA against numerous members of this class of antibiotics. An Achilles' heel of MRSA, PBP2a represents a substantial target to design novel antibiotics to tackle MRSA threat via inhibition of the bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. In this review we bring into focus the PBP2a enzyme and examine the various aspects related to its role in conferring resistance to MRSA strains.

LvPLP contains a 540 bp open reading frame, encoding a protein of 179 amino acids that includes a single carbohydrate-recognition domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that LvPLP was clustered into a single group together with other perlucins from molluscs. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that LvPLP was expressed mainly in the hemocytes, hemolymph, heart and gills. The transcription of LvPLP was significantly induced at 9\u00a0h by both Gram<sup>-</sup> bacteria Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio anguillarum. Meanwhile, recombinant LvPLP (rLvPLP) bound directly to lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan with different affinity. rLvPLP showed a strong ability to bind to Gram<sup>+</sup> (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and Gram<sup>-</sup> bacteria (V. parahaemolyticus and V. anguillarum), and could induce agglutination of V. parahaemolyticus and V. anguillarum, but not S. aureus and B. subtilis in the presence Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no study regarding HCD fermentation, overproduction and purification of thermostable bacteriophage lysin has been reported. Here, by employing a glucose-limited fed-batch strategy, we performed high density fermentation of the host Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells, compared the efficiency of high pressure homogenization, ultrasonication and thermolysis in bacterial cell disruption after HCD cultivation, and purified TSPphg, a thermostable lysin derived from extremophilic bacteriophage TSP4. On the 20-L scale, the overproduction level of TSPphg was up to 67.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7%. In total, we obtained a broth titer of 3322.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026\u00a0mg/L TSPphg with a purity of 95.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7% from a bacterial cell mass of 86.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9\u00a0g/L after 26\u00a0h of fermentation. The overall productivity of TSPphg was 127.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0mg/L/h. Additionally, the antimicrobial activity of purified TSPphg against both Gram-negative (Escherichia coli O157) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) pathogenic bacteria was further confirmed by scanning electron microscope analysis. Summarily, for the first time, we have established a relatively stable and efficient HCD cultivation and purification process for recovery of thermostable lysins from extremophilic Thermus bacteriophages.

Radiological evaluation revealed a benign radiolucent cystic lesion of the calcaneus surrounded by a sclerotic rim. This condition was accompanied by perilesional bone marrow edema. Thereafter, surgical treatment was planned. During surgery, the content of the lesion was observed to be purulent. Meticulous intralesional debridement was performed, and antibiotic-loaded bone cement beads were placed. Subsequent to microbiological and pathological examinations, the cystic lesion was confirmed to be a Brodie abscess; however, direct clinical evidence of an intraosseous infection was lacking. The patient was followed up for 14 months with no complications until recovery. A Brodie abscess may mimic bone tumors. The onset of a Brodie abscess is insidious, and the clinical findings of such lesions may be obscure.

Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) cell viability assays of scaffold ion release extracts revealed that BRT0 scaffolds (0 mol% titanium) inhibited cell proliferation and activity at day 14. At day 30, all scaffold extracts decreased cell proliferation and activity significantly. However, live/dead cell assay results demonstrated that degradation products from all the scaffolds had no inhibitory effect on cell viability. Significant bactericidal efficacies of BRT3 extracts against Escherishia coli (Gram-negative) and BRT1 extracts against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (both Gram-positive bacteria) were demonstrated. Finally, evaluation of the cell / bioactive glass surface interactions showed well-spread cells on the surface of the BRT3 glass discs and BRT1 and BRT3 scaffolds, when compared to BRT0 and BRT4 scaffolds. The results indicate that by changing the Ti<sup>4+</sup> : B<sup>3+</sup> ratio, the ion release and consequently cell proliferation could be improved.

The structures of 1 and 2 were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Compounds 1 and 2 were found to have antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) 2 and 4\u2009\u03bcg ml<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, for 1, and 2\u2009\u03bcg ml<sup>-1</sup> for both pathogens for 2. The MICs for 1 and 2, against all tested Gram-negative bacteria, were >32\u2009\u03bcg ml<sup>-1</sup>. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations against HepG2 cells for compounds 1 and 2 were 11 and 18\u2009\u03bcg ml<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, which suggested 1 and 2 be too toxic for further evaluation as possible new antibacterial drugs. Stable isotope labelling experiments showed the pyrrolidinyl group of 1 to originate from ornithine and the piperidinyl group of 2 to originate from lysine. The P. protegens acetyl transferase (PpATase) is involved in the biosynthesis of monoacetylphloroglucinol and DAPG. No optical rotation was detected for 1 or 2, and a possible reason for this was investigated by studying if the PpATase may catalyse a stereo-non-specific introduction of the pyrrolidinyl/piperidinyl group in 1 and 2, but unless the PpATase can be subjected to major conformational changes, the enzyme cannot be involved in this reaction. The PpATase is, however, likely to catalyse the formation of 2,4,6-triacetylphloroglucinol from DAPG."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Sciences, Uppsala BioCenter, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, P.O.

It produces extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are involved in cellular communication and enable inter-kingdom crosstalk, the delivery of virulence factors and modulation of the host immune response. The protein content of EVs determines their biological functions. Clarifying which proteins are selected, and how, is of crucial value to understanding the role of EVs in pathogenesis and the development of molecular delivery systems. Here, we postulated that S. aureus EVs share a common proteome containing components involved in cargo sorting. The EV proteomes of five S. aureus strains originating from human, bovine, and ovine hosts were characterised. The clustering of EV proteomes reflected the diversity of the producing strains. A total of 253 proteins were identified, 119 of which composed a core EV proteome with functions in bacterial survival, pathogenesis, and putatively in EV biology. We also identified features in the sequences of EV proteins and the corresponding genes that could account for their packaging into EVs. Our findings corroborate the hypothesis of a selective sorting of proteins into EVs and offer new perspectives concerning the roles of EVs in S. aureus pathogenesis in specific host niches."]},

This structure is considered an important virulence factor because it is difficult to eradicate and often responsible for treatment failures. This adherent community represents one of the greatest problems in public health due to the continued emergence of conventional antibiotic-therapy resistance. Photodynamic Antimicrobial Therapy (PACT) is a therapeutic alternative and promises to be an effective treatment against multiresistant bacteria biofilm, demonstrating a broad spectrum of action. This work demonstrates the reduction in biofilms of relevant clinical isolates (as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus) treated with PACT using low concentrations of amoxicillin-coated gold nanoparticles (amoxi@AuNP) as a photosensitizer. Moreover, the viability reduction of 60% in S. aureus biofilms and 70% in P. aeruginosa biofilms were obtained after three hours of irradiation with white light and amoxi@AuNP. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that amoxi@AuNP could penetrate and cause damage to the biofilm matrix, and interact with bacteria cells. A strong biofilm production in P. aeruginosa was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using acridine orange as a probe, and a markedly decrease in live bacteria was appreciated when PACT was applied. The use of amoxi@AuNP for PACT allows the viability reduction of clinical Gram positive and Gram negative biofilms. This novel strategy needs shorter irradiation times and lower concentrations of nanoparticles than other reports described. This could be attributed to two major innovations: the selectivity for the bacterial wall given by the amoxicillin and the polydispersity of size and shapes with seems to contribute to the photo-antibacterial capacity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.

Particle size distribution, mean drop size, \u03b6-potential, polymer dispersity index (PDI), and microstructure were determined to confirm emulsion stability. Well-distributed emulsion droplets maintained under a good condition and encapsulated by SSOS resulted in homogeneous and stable emulsions. The obtained mixed oil-loaded Pickering emulsions were incorporated into the SSOS film preparation, and the morphological, physical, and functional characteristics of the active film were studied. An optimal CEO/corn oil ratio decreased tensile strength but improved elongation at break, water vapor permeability, and oxygen permeability. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed that the SSOS membrane matrix is compatible with Pickering emulsions incorporated with mixed oil. Moreover, a significant decrease was observed in loss of CEO by the Pickering emulsion method.

The etiology of AD is complex and has not been fully clarified, involving genetic susceptibility, immunological abnormalities, epidermal barrier dysfunction, and environmental factors. Xyloglucan (XG) and pea protein (PP) are two compounds of natural origin characterized by the ability to create a physical barrier that protects mucosae membranes, reducing inflammation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of XG + PP in both a mouse model of AD and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>S.aureus</i>) infection- associated AD. Mice were topically treated with 200 \u03bcL of 0.5% oxazolone on the dorsal skin three times a week for AD induction. Mice received XG and PP by topical administration 1 h before oxazolone treatment. In <i>S. aureus</i> infection-associated AD, to induce a superficial superinfection of the skin, mice were also treated with 5 \u03bcL of 10<sup>8</sup> of a culture of <i>S. aureus</i> for 2 weeks; mice superinfected received XG and PP by topical administration 1 h before oxazolone + <i>S. aureus</i>. Four weeks later, the skin was removed for histological and biochemical analysis. Our results demonstrated the protective barrier effects of XG and PP characterized by a reduction in histological tissue changes, mastocyte degranulation, and tight junction permeability in the skin following oxazolone treatment. Moreover, XG + PP was able to preserve filaggrin expression, a hallmark of AD. Our data also support the effectiveness of XG + PP to reduce the damage by superinfection post AD induced by <i>S. aureus</i>. In conclusion, a future product containing XG and PP could be considered as a potentially interesting approach for the treatment of AD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Viale Ferdinando Stagno D'Alcontres, 31-98166 Messina, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Campolo", "ForeName": "Michela", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Viale Ferdinando Stagno D'Alcontres, 31-98166 Messina, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Casili", "ForeName": "Giovanna", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Viale Ferdinando Stagno D'Alcontres, 31-98166 Messina, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paterniti", "ForeName": "Irene", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Viale Ferdinando Stagno D'Alcontres, 31-98166 Messina, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Filippone", "ForeName": "Alessia", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Viale Ferdinando Stagno D'Alcontres, 31-98166 Messina, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lanza", "ForeName": "Marika", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Viale Ferdinando Stagno D'Alcontres, 31-98166 Messina, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ardizzone", "ForeName": "Alessio", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Viale Ferdinando Stagno D'Alcontres, 31-98166 Messina, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scuderi", "ForeName": "Sarah A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Viale Ferdinando Stagno D'Alcontres, 31-98166 Messina, Italy."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6131-3690"], "LastName": "Cuzzocrea", "ForeName": "Salvatore", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Viale Ferdinando Stagno D'Alcontres, 31-98166 Messina, Italy."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-2663-6387"], "LastName": "Esposito", "ForeName": "Emanuela", "Initials": "E"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "Devintec sagl", "Agency": "Devintec sagl", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int J Mol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101092791", "ISSNLinking": "1422-0067"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "03", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "04", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32438777", "ijms21103596", "10.3390/ijms21103596"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [["Nepeta juncea Benth", "bioactive compounds", "biological activities", "human cancer cells"]], "PMID": "32438667", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "22"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "19"}], "ELocationID": ["E646", "10.3390/plants9050646"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "2223-7747", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "9", "Issue": "5", "PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "May", "Day": "19"}}, "Title": "Plants (Basel, Switzerland)", "ISOAbbreviation": "Plants (Basel)"}, "ArticleTitle": "Phytochemical Analysis and Biological Investigation of <i>Nepeta juncea</i> Benth.

Synthesized NAPs were also investigated for photocatalytic dye degradation potential against methylene blue (MB), and adsorption activity against Cr(VI) was also determined. Results from Scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the successful synthesis of NAPs with spherical morphology and crystalline nature. Biological activity results demonstrated that synthesized AI-MnO NAPs exhibited significant antibacterial and cytotoxicity propensities against pathogenic microbes and cancerous cells, respectively, compared with plant extract. Moreover, synthesized AI-MnO NAPs demonstrated the comparable biological activities results to standard drugs. These excellent biological activities results are attributed to the existence of the plant's biological molecules on their surfaces and small particle size (synergetic effect). Synthesized NAPs displayed better MB-photocatalyzing properties under sunlight than an ultraviolet lamp. The Cr(VI) adsorption result showed that synthesized NAPs efficiently adsorbed more Cr(VI) at higher acidic pH than at basic pH. Hence, the current findings suggest that <i>Abutilon indicum</i> is a valuable source for tailoring the potential of NAPs toward various enhanced biological, photocatalytic, and adsorption activities.

Phenolic compounds like gallic acid are known to inhibit bacterial growth, while hamamelitannin is known to inhibit staphylococcal pathogenesis (biofilm formation and toxin production). WH was tested in vitro for its antibacterial activity against clinically relevant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and its synergy with antibiotics determined using checkerboard assays followed by isobologram analysis. WH was also tested for its ability to suppress staphylococcal pathogenesis, which is the cause of a myriad of resistant infections. Here we show that WH inhibits the growth of all bacteria tested, with variable efficacy levels. The most WH-sensitive bacteria tested were <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis,</i><i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> and <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>, followed by <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Escherichia coli,</i><i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i> and <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>. Furthermore, WH was shown on <i>S. aureus</i> to be synergistic to linezolid and chloramphenicol and cumulative to vancomycin and amikacin. The effect of WH was tested on staphylococcal pathogenesis and shown here to inhibit biofilm formation (tested on <i>S. epidermidis</i>) and toxin production (tested on <i>S. aureus</i> Enterotoxin A (SEA)). Toxin inhibition was also evident in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin that induces pathogenesis. Put together, our study indicates that WH is very effective in inhibiting the growth of multiple types of bacteria, is synergistic to antibiotics, and is also effective against staphylococcal pathogenesis, often the cause of persistent infections. Our study thus suggests the benefits of using WH to combat various types of bacterial infections, especially those that involve resistant persistent bacterial pathogens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Albany, CA 94710, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rasooly", "ForeName": "Reuven", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Food Science, Framingham State University, Framingham, MA 01701, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Hwang-Yong", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Albany, CA 94710, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-7865-0295"], "LastName": "Do", "ForeName": "Paula", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, Marche Polytechnic University, 60121 Ancona, Italy."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0772-0214"], "LastName": "Morroni", "ForeName": "Gianluca", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, Marche Polytechnic University, 60121 Ancona, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brescini", "ForeName": "Lucia", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, Marche Polytechnic University, 60121 Ancona, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cirioni", "ForeName": "Oscar", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, Marche Polytechnic University, 60121 Ancona, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Giacometti", "ForeName": "Andrea", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Food Science, Framingham State University, Framingham, MA 01701, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Apostolidis", "ForeName": "Emmanouil", "Initials": "E"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "58-2030-8-033, 2018", "Agency": "Agricultural Research Service", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Antibiotics (Basel)", "NlmUniqueID": "101637404", "ISSNLinking": "2079-6382"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "04", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "09"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32438609", "antibiotics9050264", "10.3390/antibiotics9050264"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [["Antimicrobial resistance", "Food safety", "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus", "Restaurant", "Sashimi"]], "PMID": "32438396", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "21"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": ["10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-19-375"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1944-9097", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "83", "Issue": "6", "PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "Jun", "Day": "01"}}, "Title": "Journal of food protection", "ISOAbbreviation": "J.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the occurrence and antimicrobial resistance profile of S. aureus, focusing on MRSA isolates, in ready-to-eat sashimi from Japanese restaurants in Salvador, Brazil. A total of 127 sashimi samples were collected directly from the take-out service in 16 restaurants. The staphylococcal isolates were identified morphologically and biochemically with standard laboratory procedures. S. aureus isolates were tested with a disk diffusion assay against seven antibiotics, and the cefoxitin and oxacillin were used to identify MRSA strains. Isolates with the MRSA phenotype were confirmed with a PCR assay. S. aureus was found in 73% of the sashimi samples, including sashimi from tuna (75.5% of samples) and salmon (72.5% of samples). Among those positive samples, 37% were contaminated with MRSA strains, found among 38.8% of salmon sashimi and 34.0% of tuna sashimi. Penicillin resistance was the most common type of antimicrobial resistance, found in 65.5% of the sashimi samples, followed by resistance to tetracycline (22.5%), erythromycin (16.0%), and ciprofloxacin (3.2%). Only two S. aureus isolates collected from different fish samples and restaurants had presumed resistance to vancomycin.

The key to the success of S. aureus as a pathogen is its ability to swiftly develop antimicrobial resistance. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is not only resistant to nearly all beta-lactams but also demonstrates resistance to several classes of antibiotics. A high prevalence of MRSA is seen across worldwide. For many decades, vancomycin remained as gold standard antibiotic for the treatment of MRSA infections. In the past decades, linezolid, daptomycin, ceftaroline and telavancin received regulatory approval for the treatment of infections caused by resistant Gram-positive pathogens. Although these drugs may offer some advantages over vancomycin, they also have significant limitations. These includes vancomycin's slow bactericidal activity, poor lung penetration and nephrotxicity;linezolid therapy induced myelosuppression and high cost of daptomycin greatly limits their clinical use. Moreover, daptomycin also gets inactivated by lung naturally occurring surfactants. Thus, currently available therapeutic options are unable to provide safe and efficacious treatment for those patients suffering from hospital-acquired pneumonia, bloodstream infections (BSIs), bone and joint infections and diabetic foot infections (DFI). An unmet need also exists for a safe and efficacious oral option for switch-over convenience and community treatment. Herein, the review is intended to describe the supporting role of anti-staphylococcal antibiotics used in the management of S. aureus infections with a special reference to levonadifloxacin. Levonadifloxacin and its prodrug alalevonadifloxacin are novel benzoquinolizine subclass of quinolone with broad-spectrum of anti-MRSA activity.

However, the mechanism that Selenium modulates mastitis is not fully clear. In this experiment, we investigated whether selenium can inhibit the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in a mouse model of Staphylococcus aureus-induced mastitis. Eighty BALB/c female mice were fed with experimental Selenium deficiency basal diet for 2\u00a0weeks to achieve the purpose of selenium consumption until pregnancy. Pregnant mice were randomly divided into four groups (control group; selenium supplement group; Staphylococcus aureus infection group and Staphylococcus aureus infection after selenium supplement group). Twenty-four hours after challenging, all mice were euthanized and mammary tissue samples were aseptically collected. Through pathological staining, western blot analysis, real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the regulation effect of Selenium on NLRP3 inflammasome was detected. The result showed that compared with the control group, selenium significantly inhibited the expression of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, Caspase-1 p20, and Pro-IL-1\u03b2 (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Meanwhile the mRNA expression and release of IL-1\u03b2 was suppressed in the treatment group compared with Staphylococcus aureus infection group (p\u2009<\u20090.01).

However, how SAgs alter the breadth of IAV-specific CD8+ T cell (TCD8) responses is unknown. Moreover, whether recall responses mediating heterosubtypic immunity to IAVs are manipulated by SAgs remains unexplored. We employed wild-type (WT) and mutant bacterial SAgs, SAg-sufficient/deficient Staphylococcus aureus strains, and WT, mouse-adapted and reassortant IAV strains in multiple in vivo settings to address the above questions. Contrary to the popular view that SAgs delete or anergize T cells, systemic administration of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) or Mycoplasma arthritidis mitogen before intraperitoneal IAV immunization enlarged the clonal size of 'select' IAV-specific TCD8 and reshuffled the hierarchical pattern of primary TCD8 responses. This was mechanistically linked to the TCR V\u03b2 makeup of the impacted clones rather than their immunodominance status. Importantly, SAg-expanded TCD8 retained their IFN-\u03b3 production and cognate cytolytic capacities. The enhancing effect of SEB on immunodominant TCD8 was also evident in primary responses to vaccination with heat-inactivated and live attenuated IAV strains administered intramuscularly and intranasally, respectively. Interestingly, in prime-boost immunization settings, the outcome of SEB administration depended strictly upon the time point at which this SAg was introduced. Accordingly, SEB injection before priming raised CD127highKLRG1low memory precursor frequencies and augmented the anamnestic responses of SEB-binding TCD8. By comparison, introducing SEB before boosting diminished recall responses to IAV-derived epitopes drastically and indiscriminately. This was accompanied by lower Ki67 and higher Fas, LAG-3 and PD-1 levels consistent with a pro-apoptotic and/or exhausted phenotype. Therefore, SAgs can have contrasting impacts on anti-IAV immunity depending on the na\u00efve/memory status and the TCR composition of exposed TCD8. Finally, local administration of SEB or infection with SEB-producing S. aureus enhanced pulmonary TCD8 responses to IAV. Our findings have clear implications for superinfections and prophylactic vaccination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meilleur", "ForeName": "Courtney E", "Initials": "CE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4005-8787"], "LastName": "Memarnejadian", "ForeName": "Arash", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shivji", "ForeName": "Adil N", "Initials": "AN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Benoit", "ForeName": "Jenna M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2874-7822"], "LastName": "Tuffs", "ForeName": "Stephen W", "Initials": "SW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of General Surgery, Department of Surgery, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6617-9790"], "LastName": "Mele", "ForeName": "Tina S", "Initials": "TS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lawson Health Research Institute, London, Ontario, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Human Immunology, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9792-8694"], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Bhagirath", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dikeakos", "ForeName": "Jimmy D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "David H.

Recent studies have shown the antibacterial properties of SPIONs against some Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. These nanoparticles (NPs) can bind to bacterial membranes via hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions and pass through cell barriers. In this study, the authors evaluated the antibacterial activity of magnetic NPs in comparison with ferrous and ferric ions. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the treated Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria were directly measured by fluorometric detection. The results showed that iron ions and SPIONs had significant dependent antimicrobial activities. SPIONs showed greater inhibitory effects than ferrous and ferric ions against the growth of treated bacterial strains under anaerobic conditions, while in aerobic conditions, ferrous showed the strongest antibacterial activity. In anaerobic conditions, they observed the greatest ROS formation and lowest minimum inhibitory concentration in the SPION-treated group in comparison with the other groups. It seems that the release of iron ions from SPIONs and subsequent activation of ROS pathway are the main antibacterial mechanisms of action.

TatD-related DNases are considered to play crucial cellular roles. However, studies of TatD from Gram-positive bacteria have been hindered by an absence of atomic detail and the resulting inability to determine function from structure. In this study, an X-ray crystal structure of SAV0491, which is the TatD enzyme from the Gram-positive bacterium <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>Sa</i>TatD), is reported at a high resolution of 1.85\u2005\u00c5 with a detailed atomic description. Although <i>Sa</i>TatD has the common TIM-barrel fold shared by most TatD-related homologs, and PDB entry 2gzx shares 100% sequence identity with SAV0491, the crystal structure of <i>Sa</i>TatD revealed a unique binding mode of two phosphates interacting with two Ni<sup>2+</sup> ions. Through a functional study, it was verified that <i>Sa</i>TatD has Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent nuclease activity as a DNase and an RNase. In addition, structural comparison with TatD homologs and the identification of key residues contributing to the binding mode of Ni<sup>2+</sup> ions and phosphates allowed mutational studies to be performed that revealed the catalytic mechanism of <i>Sa</i>TatD. Among the key residues composing the active site, the acidic residues Glu92 and Glu202 had a critical impact on catalysis by <i>Sa</i>TatD. Furthermore, based on the binding mode of the two phosphates and structural insights, a putative DNA-binding mode of <i>Sa</i>TatD was proposed using <i>in silico</i> docking. Overall, these findings may serve as a good basis for understanding the relationship between the structure and function of TatD proteins from Gram-positive bacteria and may provide critical insights into the DNA-binding mode of <i>Sa</i>TatD."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Kyu-Yeon Lee et al. 2020."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of

The possible role of intestinal MRSA in prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is unknown.", "Rats underwent intestinal colonization with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged MRSA by gavage and an intra-articular wire was then surgically implanted. After ten days, the presence of PJI was determined by bacterial cultures of the distal femur, joint capsule, and implant. We excluded several other possibilities for PJI development. Intraoperative contamination was excluded by culturing the specimen obtained from surgical site. Extracellular bacteraemia-associated PJI was excluded by comparing with the infection rate after intravenous injection of MRSA or MRSA-carrying neutrophils. To further support this theory, we tested the efficacy of prophylactic membrane-permeable and non-membrane-permeable antibiotics in this model.", "After undergoing knee surgery eight or 72 hours after colonization, five out of 20 rats (25.0%) and two out of 20 rats (10.0%) developed PJI, respectively. Strikingly, 11 out of 20 rats (55.0%) developed PJI after intravenous injection of MRSA-carrying neutrophils that were isolated from rats with intestinal MRSA colonization. None of the rats receiving intravenous injections of MRSA developed PJI. These results suggest that intestinal MRSA carried by neutrophils could cause PJI in our rat model.

The autophagy flux induced by the <i>S. aureus</i> was also evaluated by immunoblot analysis and fluorescent labeling method for autophagy marker protein LC3. In addition, lysosomal alkalization and degradation ability were assessed using confocal microscopy. Results showed that, after infection, a double-layer membrane structure around the <i>S. aureus</i> was observed in BMECs, indicating that autophagy occurred. The change in autophagy marker protein and fluorescent labeling of autophagosome also confirmed autophagy. However, as time prolonged, the autophagy flux was markedly inhibited, leading to obvious autophagosome accumulation. At the same time, the lysosomal alkalization and degradation ability of BMECs were impaired. Collectively, these results indicated that <i>S. aureus</i> could escape autophagic degradation by inhibiting autophagy flux and damaging lysosomal function after invading BMECs."],

{"AbstractText": ["Tomatidine (TO), a steroid alkaloid, exerts a strong bactericidal activity on the infection-persistent phenotype of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, the small-colony variant (SCV), with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.06 \u03bcg/ml. Also, the combination of TO to an aminoglycoside (AMG) shows a strong synergistic effect against prototypical (WT) <i>S. aureus</i> (MIC 0.06 \u03bcg/ml), which is otherwise unaffected by TO alone (MIC > 128 \u03bcg/ml). We have recently established that the ATP synthase (subunit AtpE) was the molecular target of TO and that TO reduces the production of ATP in <i>S. aureus</i>. The purpose of this study was to understand how TO and the TO-AMG combination exert bactericidal activities against <i>S. aureus</i> SCV and WT strains, respectively. The impact of TO and of the TO-gentamicin (GEN) combination on the membrane potential and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined using florescent probes. GEN uptake in WT was assessed in the presence of TO. Virulence of SCV and WT strains as well as of <i>in vitro</i>-selected mutants showing resistance to TO or the TO-GEN combination was evaluated in a murine thigh infection model. TO causes a reduction in membrane potential in both WT and SCV, but significant amounts of ROS are only produced in SCVs. Besides, the presence of TO improves the uptake of GEN by the WT strain and the combination TO-GEN generated 2.5-folds more ROS in WT, compared to that induced by GEN alone. Under anaerobic conditions, WT adopts a fermentative slow-growth phenotype and becomes susceptible to TO even if used alone. <i>In vivo</i>, TO- or TO-GEN-resistant strains were significantly altered in their ability to colonize tissues. These results shed light on the mechanism of action of TO and its synergy with AMGs against <i>S. aureus</i> WT. TO bactericidal activity against SCVs is attributable to both a critical drop in the membrane potential accompanied by a substantial ROS production. In the WT, TO helps GEN uptake and ROS is also important for the synergy. Acquiring resistance to TO significantly impairs virulence. The residual ATP synthase activity of SCVs might represent the Achilles' heel of persistent <i>S. aureus</i>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Langlois, Millette, Guay,

common human pathogen, which can cause a variety of infections from mild to severe. In this article, a new diagnostic method called multiplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification combined with nanoparticles-based lateral flow biosensor (mLAMP-LFB) has been developed, which was proved to be fast, reliable, and simple for detecting <i>S. aureus</i>, and differentiate MRSA from methicillin-susceptible <i>S. aureus</i> (MSSA).", "We designed a set of six primers targeting the <i>nuc</i> gene of <i>S. aureus</i>, and a set of five primers targeting the <i>mecA</i> gene of MRSA. The lateral flow biosensor visually reported the <i>S. aureus</i>-LAMP results within 2 mins. <i>S. aureus</i> species and non-<i>S. aureus</i> species were used to identify the specificity and sensitivity of the assay.", "The best conditions for LAMP were 50 mins at 63\u00b0C, and the sensitivity was 100 fg. No cross-reactivity was shown and the specificity of this assay is 100%. This assay requires 20 mins for DNA preparation, 50 mins for isothermal amplification and 2 mins for biosensor detection. The total time is within 75 mins. Among 96 sputum samples, LAMP-LFB and traditional culture method showed the same results, 8 (8.33%) samples were MRSA-positive, and 9 (9.38%) samples were MSSA-positive. Seven (7.29%) samples were MRSA-positive and 7 (7.29%) were\u00a0MSSA-positive by PCR method. Compared with the culture method, diagnostic accuracy of m-LAMP-LFB assay was 100%. The results showed that the m-LAMP-LFB method has better detection ability than the\u00a0PCR method.", "In short, this m-LAMP-LFB assay is a specific and sensitive method that can quickly identify <i>S. aureus</i> stains, and distinguish MRSA from MSSA, and can be used as a new molecular method for detection of <i>S. aureus</i> in laboratories."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Jiang et

for a wide range of applications. Commonly named copaiba, the oleoresin has been found to exhibit strong antimicrobial effects in our previous study, which could be attributed to some of its diterpenoid constituents. In order to find new biological activities and to eventually enhance the before observed effects, (-)-polyalthic acid (<b>1</b>) and kaurenoic acid (<b>2</b>), together with eight prepared semi-synthetic derivatives (<b>1a</b>-<b>1c</b> and <b>2a</b>-<b>2e</b>) were evaluated for their cytotoxic, antibacterial and antifungal properties. Regarding the gram-positive bacteria <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> and methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, we found that both the exocylic methylene group and the carboxyl group were crucial for the activity against these two clinically relevant bacterial strains. Investigation of the antifungal activity, in contrast, showed that the carboxyl group is unnecessary for the effect against the dermatophytes <i>Trichophyton rubrum</i> and <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>, indicated by low micromolar IC<sub>50</sub> values for both (-)-polyalthic acid diethylamide (<b>1a</b>) as well as (-)-polyalthic acid methyl ester (<b>1b</b>). Apart from studying the biological activity, the structure of one semi-synthetic derivative, compound <b>1c</b>, is being reported for the first time. During the course of the structure elucidation of the new compound, we discovered inconsistencies regarding the stereochemistry of polyalthic acid and its stereoisomers, which we clarified in the present work.

["Poly(<i>N</i>-vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP)-based hydrogels with titania nanoparticles (TN) were synthesized by the sol-gel method for the first time and were characterized in different states (native, freeze-dried, air-dried to constant weight and ground to powder, or swollen to constant weight in H<sub>2</sub>O or D<sub>2</sub>O) by various methods such as wide-angle and small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering, neutron spin-echo (NSE) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The static (static polymer-polymer correlation length (mesh size), associates of cross-links and PVP microchains) and dynamic (polymer chain relaxation rate, hydrodynamic polymer-polymer correlation length) structural elements were determined. The incorporation of titania nanoparticles into PVP hydrogel slightly increases the size of structural inhomogeneities (an increase in the static and dynamic polymer-polymer correlation length, the formation of associates of cross-links and PVP chains).

system to activate exogenous FAs for membrane synthesis. We developed a lipidomics workflow to determine the membrane phosphatidylglycerol (PG) molecular species synthesized by <i>S. aureus</i> at the thigh infection site. Wild-type <i>S. aureus</i> utilizes both host palmitate and oleate to acylate the 1 position of PG, and the 2 position is occupied by pentadecanoic acid arising from <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis. Inactivation of FakB2 eliminates the ability to assimilate oleate and inactivation of FakB1 reduces the content of saturated FAs and enhances oleate utilization. Elimination of FA activation in either \u0394<i>fakA</i> or \u0394<i>fakB1</i> \u0394<i>fakB2</i> mutants does not impact growth. All <i>S. aureus</i> strains recovered from the thigh have significantly reduced branched-chain FAs and increased even-chain FAs compared to that with growth in rich laboratory medium. The molecular species pattern observed in the thigh was reproduced in the laboratory by growth in isoleucine-deficient medium containing exogenous FAs. <i>S. aureus</i> utilizes specific host FAs for membrane biosynthesis but also requires <i>de novo</i> FA biosynthesis initiated by isoleucine (or leucine) to produce pentadecanoic acid.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The shortage of antibiotics against drug-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> has led to the development of new drugs targeting the elongation cycle of fatty acid (FA) synthesis that are progressing toward the clinic. An objection to the use of FA synthesis inhibitors is that <i>S. aureus</i> can utilize exogenous FAs to construct its membrane, suggesting that the bacterium would bypass these therapeutics by utilizing host FAs instead. We developed a mass spectrometry workflow to determine the composition of the <i>S. aureus</i> membrane at the infection site to directly address how <i>S. aureus</i> uses host FAs. <i>S. aureus</i> strains that cannot acquire host FAs are as effective in establishing an infection as the wild type, but strains that require the utilization of host FAs for growth were attenuated in the mouse thigh infection model. We find that <i>S. aureus</i> does utilize host FAs to construct its membrane, but host FAs do not replace the requirement for pentadecanoic acid, a branched-chain FA derived from isoleucine (or leucine) that predominantly occupies the 2 position of <i>S. aureus</i> phospholipids. The membrane phospholipid structure of <i>S. aureus</i> mutants that cannot utilize host FAs indicates the isoleucine is a scarce resource at the infection site. This reliance on the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of predominantly pentadecanoic acid that cannot be obtained from the host is one reason why drugs that target fatty acid synthesis are effective in treating <i>S. aureus</i> infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Frank et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frank", "ForeName": "Matthew W", "Initials": "MW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Jiangwei", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Batte", "ForeName": "Justin L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gullett", "ForeName": "Jessica M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Subramanian", "ForeName": "Chitra", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosch", "ForeName": "Jason W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA charles.rock@stjude.org."}], "Identifier": ["https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8648-4189"], "LastName": "Rock", "ForeName": "Charles O", "Initials": "CO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "mBio", "NlmUniqueID": "101519231"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32430471", "mBio.00920-20", "10.1128/mBio.00920-20"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [["Staphylococcus aureus", "atopic dermatitis", "close contacts", "genetic profile"]], "PMID": "32430095", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "20"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "20"}], "ELocationID": ["10.1099/jmm.0.001197"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1473-5644", "JournalIssue": {"PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "May", "Day": "20"}}, "Title": "Journal of medical microbiology", "ISOAbbreviation": "J.

He reported a cutaneous back abscess 3\u2009weeks before. CT-scan was consistent with mediastinitis and blood cultures grew for a PVL+ MSSA. Intravenous clindamycin (600\u2009mg\u2009t.i.d) and cloxacillin (2\u2009g q.i.d.), secondary changed for fosfomycin (4\u2009g q.i.d.) because of a related toxidermia, was administered. Surgical drainage was performed and confirmed the presence of a mediastinal abscess associated with a fistula between the mediastinum and right pleural space. All local bacteriological samples also grew for PVL+ MSSA. In addition to clindamycin, intravenous fosfomycin was switched to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole after 4\u2009weeks for a total of 10\u2009weeks of antibiotics.", "We present the first community-acquired mediastinitis of hematogenous origin with PVL+ MSSA.

We excluded patients without drain tip culture and those with abdominal or systemic complications before removal of drains. Demographic, clinical (pre-transplant, peri-operative and post-transplant) and microbiologic information were collected up to 30 days after operation.

The hybrid UCNPs/PSeV PS showed strong ROS generation ability and high photothermal conversion efficiency (\u223c52.5%) under the mildest reported-to-date irradiation conditions (\u03bb = 980 nm, 150 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, 4 min), leading to a high efficiency in killing methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Remarkably, after intravenous injection, the reported PS accumulated preferentially in deep MRSA-infected tissues and achieved an excellent therapeutic index. This PS design realizes a low-power single-NIR light-triggered synergistic phototherapy and provides a simple and versatile strategy to develop safe clinically translatable agents for efficient treatment of deep tissue bacterial inflammations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Frontier Institute of Science and Technology, State Key Laboratory for

TNS specimens were treated by a piezoelectric direct discharge (PDD) plasma generator. The effect of decontamination was performed utilizing <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. The evaluation of initial cell attachment with adhesion images, alkaline phosphatase activity, extracellular matrix mineralization, and expression of genes related to osteogenesis was performed using rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, and the bone response were evaluated in vivo using a rat femur model. Nanotopography and surface roughness did not significantly differ before and after plasma treatments. Cell and bone formation activity were improved by TNS plasma treatment. Furthermore, plasma treatment effectively eliminated biofilm contamination from the surface.

genomes (MAGs) becomes more effective. Phylogenetic placement methods to contextualize hundreds of thousands of genomes must thus be efficiently scalable and sensitive from closely related strains to divergent phyla. We present PhyloPhlAn 3.0, an accurate, rapid, and easy-to-use method for large-scale microbial genome characterization and phylogenetic analysis at multiple levels of resolution. PhyloPhlAn 3.0 can assign genomes from isolate sequencing or MAGs to species-level genome bins built from >230,000 publically available sequences. For individual clades of interest, it reconstructs strain-level phylogenies from among the closest species using clade-specific maximally informative markers. At the other extreme of resolution, it scales to large phylogenies comprising >17,000 microbial species. Examples including Staphylococcus aureus isolates, gut metagenomes, and meta-analyses demonstrate the ability of PhyloPhlAn 3.0 to support genomic and metagenomic analyses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3732-1468"], "LastName": "Asnicar", "ForeName": "Francesco", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5789-3354"], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "Andrew Maltez", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8105-9607"], "LastName": "Beghini", "ForeName": "Francesco", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mengoni", "ForeName": "Claudia", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6371-528X"], "LastName": "Manara", "ForeName": "Serena", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manghi", "ForeName": "Paolo", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Qiyun", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PreBiomics s.r.l, Trento, Italy."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8539-9468"], "LastName": "Bolzan", "ForeName": "Mattia", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2920-5838"], "LastName": "Cumbo", "ForeName": "Fabio", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "May", "ForeName": "Uyen", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cornell Institute for Host-Microbe Interaction and Disease, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6077-4014"], "LastName": "Sanders", "ForeName": "Jon G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6661-4046"], "LastName": "Zolfo", "ForeName": "Moreno", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clarity Genomics BVBA, Sint-Michielskaai 34, 2000, Antwerpen, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kopylova", "ForeName": "Evguenia", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, Portici, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pasolli", "ForeName": "Edoardo", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Microbiome Innovation, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0975-9019"], "LastName": "Knight", "ForeName": "Rob", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5410-1518"], "LastName": "Mirarab", "ForeName": "Siavash", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.

Risk factors for colonization were documented.<b>Results.</b> Seven of the 146 (5\u200a%) patients undergoing THA were carriers of MRSA in the nostrils and/or the groin. Recent antibiotic use was identified as a risk factor for colonization, OR=4.86 [95\u202f% confidence interval (CI): 1.56-13.96]. Patients reporting at least one of the seven surveyed risk factors had an OR of 2.39 (95\u202f% CI: 0.37-25.77) for colonization.

Nowadays, these dairy products are also important for people with an allergy to cow milk, and these products are an essential part of the local daily diet in regions of the world that are not suitable for cows and goats. Consumption of raw milk and raw milk products has a zoonotic risk, and with regard to sheep, the main pathogens associated with such dairy products are: <i>Brucella melitensis</i>, <i>Campylobacter</i> spp., <i>Listeria</i> spp., <i>Salmonella</i> spp., Shiga-toxin producing <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, tick borne encephalitis virus, and <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. Especially, young children, elderly people, pregnant women and immunocompromised (YOPI) persons, and those suffering from disease should be aware of the risk of consuming raw milk and raw milk products. This latter risk can be reduced by proper flock health management, prevention of contamination during milking, adequate milk processing, transport, and refrigerated storage. Only processes equaling pasteurization sufficiently reduce zoonotic risks from milk and milk products, but proper cooling is essential and recontamination must be prevented. Therefore, strict hygiene practices throughout the production process and supply chain especially for raw milk and raw dairy products, should be applied. Small scale production systems pose a greater risk compared to industrialized production systems because of a less protocolized and controlled production process. This manuscript describes zoonotic risks of pathogens from sheep and their milk borne transmission. Additionally, routes of contamination, possibilities for multiplication, and prevention measures thereof are described. We summarize some major human outbreaks caused by consumption of sheep milk and products made thereof, and finally discuss their implications."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.

{"AbstractText": ["Bacterial persisters form a subpopulation of cells that survive lethal concentrations of antibiotics without being genetically different from the susceptible population. They are generally considered to be phenotypic variants that spontaneously have entered a dormant state with low ATP levels or reduced membrane potential. In <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, a serious opportunistic human pathogen, persisters are believed to contribute to chronic infections that are a major global healthcare problem. While <i>S. aureus</i> persisters have mostly been studied in laboratory strains, we have here investigated the ability of clinical strains to form persisters. For 44 clinical strains belonging to the major clonal complexes CC5, CC8, CC30 or CC45, we examined persister cell formation in stationary phase when exposed to 100 times the MIC of ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that targets DNA replication. We find that while all strains are able to form persisters, those belonging to CC30 displayed on average 100-fold higher persister cell frequencies when compared to strains of other CCs. Importantly, there was no correlation between persister formation and the cellular ATP content of the individual strains, but the group of CC30 strains displayed slightly lower membrane potential compared to the non-CC30 group. CC30 strains have previously been associated with chronic and reoccuring infections and we hypothesize that there could be a correlation between lineage-specific characteristics displayed via <i>in vitro</i> persister assays and the observed clinical spectrum of disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Stigb\u00f8jlen 4, 1870 Frederiksberg C, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Liping", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Stigb\u00f8jlen 4, 1870 Frederiksberg C, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Stigb\u00f8jlen 4, 1870 Frederiksberg C, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bojer", "ForeName": "Martin Saxtorph", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbial Pathogenesis and Host Susceptibility, Department of Bacteria, Parasites and Fungi, Statens Serum Institut, Artillerivej 5, 2300 K\u00f8benhavn S, Denmark."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Stigb\u00f8jlen 4, 1870 Frederiksberg C, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Andersen", "ForeName": "Paal Skytt", "Initials": "PS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Stigb\u00f8jlen 4, 1870 Frederiksberg C, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ingmer", "ForeName": "Hanne", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Microbiology", "NlmUniqueID": "9430468", "ISSNLinking": "1350-0872"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["32427093", "10.1099/mic.0.000926"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [["critical care", "infectious diseases", "pharmacokinetics"]], "PMID": "32426841", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "19"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": ["10.1093/ajhp/zxaa066"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1535-2900", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "77", "Issue": "11", "PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "May", "Day": "19"}}, "Title": "American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists", "ISOAbbreviation": "Am J Health Syst Pharm"}, "ArticleTitle": "Pharmacokinetics of linezolid for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia in an adult receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.", "Pagination": {"MedlinePgn": "877-881"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["We present a case of a 55-year-old man post right lung transplantation receiving ECMO for treatment of respiratory failure secondary to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia.", "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a frequently utilized support therapy for patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure.

All patients who required mechanical ventilation and were therefore subject to an orotracheal intubation and those who underwent a conventional tracheostomy were considered for inclusion. Patients who had been intubated in other hospitals or ICUs, other airways infection issues were excluded from this study. Data's were collected from computer based hospital management system, operation theatre and registers in Medical records department and entered in a preformed questionnaire before thorough analysis. The specimens for swab was obtained from the cut tracheostomy tube tips and the samples were sent to microbiology laboratory for isolation of the organism and obtain an antibiogram to know the susceptibility and resistance to antibiotics.

The most commonest organisms in both genders was <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> closely followed by <i>Acinetobacter baumanii</i>. In children under age of 12, it was <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and in adults the impending organism was <i>Acinetobacter baumanii</i>. In terms of antiobiograms, 89% of <i>Acinetobacter</i>, 38% of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, 37% of <i>Klebsiella</i> and 54% of <i>Proteus mirabilis</i> were resistant to ciprofloxacin.

However, the leaching of the antimicrobial component and deterioration of antimicrobial properties remain a concern. In this work, an antimicrobial PVDF (PVDF-<i>g</i>-AGE-PHMG) was developed by chemical bonding PVDF with poly(hexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride) (PHMG). The obtained PVDF-<i>g</i>-AGE-PHMG was blended with pristine PVDF to prepare an antimicrobial PVDF membrane.

The morphologies, membrane porosity, water contact angles, antimicrobial properties, mechanical properties, and thermostability of the as-prepared membranes were investigated. When the content of PVDF-<i>g</i>-AGE-PHMG reached 10.0 wt %, the inhibition rates of both antimicrobial PVDF membrane against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> were above 99.99%.

The endotracheal tube (ETT) used during the ventilation process provides a surface that can allow bacterial colonization and biofilm formation, which can lead to VAP. Although various approaches, including ETT design and material selection, as well as antimicrobial coatings have been employed to minimize adverse events, VAP remains a significant unresolved clinical issue. In this study, we have utilized a novel styrylbenzene-based antimicrobial (BCP3) in a simple and robust coating that allows its long-term release at an effective level. BCP3 was applied onto PVC ETT segments blended together with poly(lactic-<i>co</i>-glycolic acid) via a facile dip-coating process with controlled loadings. In vitro studies demonstrated concentration-dependent release of BCP3 from the coatings for at least 31 days. Bacterial assays using major VAP culprits, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</i> demonstrated significant growth inhibition, with a stronger effect on <i>S. aureus</i>. Despite its ability to inhibit bacterial growth, BCP3 showed no cytotoxicity toward mammalian (L929) fibroblasts, which makes it attractive from a clinical perspective.

However, most series do not differentiate between SEAs associated with pyogenic infectious spondylodiscitis (PS) and SEAs limited to the epidural space. <b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively reviewed the records and radiological images of all patients admitted to our institutions with a diagnosis of SEA not associated with PS between January 2013 and December 2018. <b>Results:</b> We found three males and four females; five of the seven were intravenous drug users. All patients presented with pain: in six, it was associated with acute motor and sensory deficits, while one had only pain and paresthesias. <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> was cultured from abscesses and/or from multiple blood cultures in four patients. Abscesses were localized to the cervical spine in one patient, thoracic in three, lumbar in one, and in two, the SEAs involved multiple segments. All patients but one underwent urgent open surgery. This patient had a multisegmental abscess and was successfully treated by percutaneous aspiration when pain became intractable. After abscess evacuation, the neurological deficits improved in all patients except one. The patients that were treated without spine instrumentation did not develop delayed kyphosis or instability at follow-up. <b>Conclusion:</b> Patients with SEAs not associated with PS are likely to present with pain and motor deficits, appear to benefit from urgent abscess evacuation, and seem to be less dependent on spine instrumentation to avoid delayed spinal deformities compared to SEA associated with PS. Finally, the lack of initial involvement of bone and intervertebral disks may suggest that at least some of the SEAs without PS originate from infection of epidural lymphatic vessels that are not present inside those structures."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Magrassi, Mussa, Montalbetti, Colaneri, di Matteo, Malfitano, Simoncelli, Egitto, Bernucci and Brunetti."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical, Surgical, Diagnostic and Pediatric Sciences, University of Pavia, IRCCS San Matteo Hospital Foundation, Pavia, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Magrassi", "ForeName": "Lorenzo", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Department of Clinical, Surgical, Diagnostic and Pediatric Sciences, IRCCS San Matteo Hospital Foundation, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mussa", "ForeName": "Marco", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical, Surgical, Diagnostic and Pediatric Sciences, University of Pavia, IRCCS San Matteo Hospital Foundation, Pavia, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurosurgery Pope John XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Montalbetti", "ForeName": "Andrea", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Department of Clinical, Surgical, Diagnostic and Pediatric Sciences, IRCCS San Matteo Hospital Foundation, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Colaneri", "ForeName": "Marta", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Hospital Foundation, Pavia, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "di Matteo", "ForeName": "Angela", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Hospital Foundation, Pavia, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Malfitano", "ForeName": "Antonello", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Diagnostic Radiology, Interventional Radiology and Neuroradiology Unit, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Hospital Foundation, Pavia, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Simoncelli", "ForeName": "Anna Maria", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Radiology Unit, Voghera Hospital, Voghera, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Egitto", "ForeName": "Maria Grazia", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurosurgery Pope John XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bernucci", "ForeName": "Claudio", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Department of Clinical, Surgical, Diagnostic and Pediatric Sciences, IRCCS San Matteo Hospital Foundation, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brunetti", "ForeName": "Enrico", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Front Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "101645127", "ISSNLinking": "2296-875X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Surg Neurol Int. 2015 Oct 08;6(Suppl 19):S475-86", "ArticleIdList": ["26605109"]}, {"Citation": "Nat Commun. 2019 Oct 9;10(1):4594", "ArticleIdList": ["31597914"]}, {"Citation": "Pain Med. 2007 May-Jun;8(4):338-43", "ArticleIdList": ["17610456"]}, {"Citation": "Surg Neurol. 2005 Apr;63(4):364-71;

Molecular-Epidemiological Analysis From 2013 to 2018.", "Pagination": {"MedlinePgn": "663"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["The prevalence of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> as an aggressive pathogen resistant to multiple antibiotics causing nosocomial and community-acquired infections is increasing with limited therapeutic options. Macrolide-lincosamide streptogramin B (MLSB) family of antibiotics represents an important alternative therapy for staphylococcal infections. This study was conducted over a period of five years from August 2013 to July 2018 to investigate the prevalence and molecular epidemiology in Iran of inducible resistance in <i>S. aureus</i>. In the current study, 126 inducible methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA) (<i>n</i> = 106) and methicillin-sensitive <i>S. aureus</i> (MSSA) (<i>n</i> = 20) isolates were characterized by <i>in vitro</i> susceptibility analysis, resistance and virulence encoding gene distribution, phenotypic and genotypic analysis of biofilm formation, prophage typing, <i>S. aureus</i> protein A locus (<i>spa</i>) typing, staphylocoagulase (SC) typing, staphylococcal cassette chromosome <i>mec</i> (SCC<i>mec</i>) typing, and multilocus sequence typing. Of the 126 isolates, 76 (60.3%) were classified as hospital onset, and 50 (39.7%) were classified as community onset (CO). Biofilm formation was observed in 97 strains (77%). A total of 14 sequence types (STs), 26 <i>spa</i> types, 7 coagulase types, 9 prophage types, 3 <i>agr</i> types (no <i>agr</i> IV), and 9 clonal complexes (CCs) were identified in this study. The prevalence of the inducible MLSB (iMLSB) <i>S. aureus</i> increased from 7.5% (25/335) to 21.7% (38/175) during the study period. The iMLSB MRSA isolates were distributed in nine CCs, whereas the MSSA isolates were less diverse, which mainly belonged to CC22 (7.95%) and CC30 (7.95%). High-level mupirocin-resistant strains belonged to ST85-SCC<i>mec</i> IV/t008 (<i>n</i> = 4), ST5-SCC<i>mec</i> IV/t002 (<i>n</i> = 4), ST239-SCC<i>mec</i> III/t631 (<i>n</i> = 2), and ST8-SCC<i>mec</i> IV/t064 (<i>n</i> = 2) clones, whereas low-level mupirocin-resistant strains belonged to ST15-SCC<i>mec</i> IV/t084 (<i>n</i> = 5), ST239-SCC<i>mec</i> III/t860 (<i>n</i> = 3), and ST22-SCC<i>me</i>c IV/t790 (<i>n</i> = 3) clones. All the fusidic acid-resistant iMLSB isolates were MRSA and belonged to ST15-SCC<i>mec</i> IV/t084 (<i>n</i> = 2), ST239-SCC<i>mec</i> III/t030 (<i>n</i> = 2), ST1-SCC<i>mec</i> V/t6811 (<i>n</i> = 1), ST80-SCC<i>mec</i> IV/t044 (<i>n</i> = 1), and ST59-SCC<i>mec</i> IV/t437 (<i>n</i> = 1). The CC22 that was predominant in 2013-2014 (36% of the isolates) had almost disappeared in 2017-2018, being replaced by the CC8, which represented 39.5% of the 2017-2018 isolates.

The bacterial cell wall plays a crucial role in antimicrobial resistance and its infection to host cells. Peptidoglycans (PGs) are a major component of the cell wall in <i>S. aureus</i>, which is heavily decorated with wall teichoic acids (WTAs) and capsular polysaccharides (CPs). The ligation of WTAs and CPs to PGs is catalyzed by LytR-CpsA-Psr (LCP) family proteins, including LcpA, LcpB, and LcpC. However, the involvement of LcpC in antimicrobial resistance of <i>S. aureus</i> and its infection to host cells remains unknown. By creating the LcpC-knockout strains, we showed that the deficiency in LcpC decreased the antimicrobial resistance to \u03b2-lactams and glycopeptides and impeded the binding to various epithelial cells. These changes were accompanied by the morphological changes in bacterial cell wall. More importantly, the knockout of LcpC significantly reduced the pathogenicity of methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA) in mice. Our results suggest that LcpC might be an appealing target for developing a therapeutic approach against MRSA infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Li, Zhai, Wu, Zhao, Qiao and

Herein we report a divergent synthesis of the cylindrocyclophane core enabling access to symmetrical macrocycles by means of a catalytic, domino cross-metathesis-ring-closing metathesis cascade, followed by late-stage diversification. Phenotypic screening identified several novel inhibitors of methicillin-resistant S. aureus . The most potent inhibitor bears a unique tetrabrominated [7,7]paracyclophane core with no known counterpart in nature.

This fact underlines the importance of developing new therapeutic strategies to address the widespread antibiotic resistance, which is the major contributing factor for clinical failures of the current therapeutics. In a screen for antibiotic adjuvants, we identified a natural product from actinomycetes, venturicidin A (VentA), that potentiates the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, the combination of gentamicin and VentA was bactericidal and rapidly eradicated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The molecular mechanism of gentamicin potentiation activity is attributed to uncoupling of ATP synthesis by VentA from electron transport presumably by blocking the proton flow through ATP synthase, which results in an elevated concentration of extracellular protons and subsequent anticipated raise in gentamicin uptake.

and lacks markers to indicate disease progression in cows and buffaloes. Thus, the focus of this study was to identify proteins marking the transition from subclinical to clinical mastitis. Whey proteins were isolated from 6 group's i.e. healthy, subclinical and clinical mastitis of Holstein Friesian cow and Murrah buffalo. Mass spectrometry and statistical analysis (ANOVA and t-tests) were performed on 12 biological samples each from cow and buffalo (4 per healthy, subclinical and clinical mastitis) resulting in a total of 24 proteome datasets. Collectively, 1479 proteins were identified of which significant proteins were shortlisted by a combination of fold change (\u2264 0.5 or\u00a0\u2265\u00a02) and q\u00a0<\u00a00.05. Of these proteins, 128 and 163 indicated disease progression in cow and buffalo, respectively. Change in expression of haptoglobin and fibronectin from Holstein Friesian while spermadhesin and osteopontin from Murrah correlated with disease progression. Similarly, angiogenin and cofilin-1 were upregulated while ubiquitin family members were downregulated during disease transition. Subsequently, selected proteins (e.g. osteopontin and fibrinogen-\u03b1) were validated by Western blots. The results of this study provide deeper insights into whey proteome dynamics and signature patterns indicative of disease progression. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Bovine mastitis is the most lethal infectious disease causing a huge economic loss in the dairy industry. In an attempt, to understand the dynamics of whey proteome in response to S. aureus infection, whey protein collected from healthy, subclinical and clinical mastitic HF and Mu were investigated. A total of 1479 proteins were identified, of which 128 and 163 had signature pattern in each stage indicative of the progression of the disease. The results of the present study provide a foundation to better understand the complexity of mastitis that will ultimately help facilitate early therapeutic and husbandry-based intervention to improve animal health and milk quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, the effect of such consultation services in patients with SAB in Japan remains unknown. Accordingly, we aimed to examine the effectiveness of infectious disease consultation in SAB patients at an accredited hospital in Japan. We hypothesized that infectious disease consultation in SAB patients is associated with lower in-hospital mortality. We identified patients with SAB between January 2011 and January 2014. SAB was defined as the presence of at least one set of positive blood culture samples. The outcomes of patients who did and did not receive bedside infectious disease consultation were compared. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. We identified 183 patients with SAB. Eighty-seven patients (48%) received infectious disease consultation services, while 96 (52%) did not. There were no significant differences in in-hospital mortality between the infectious disease consultation and control groups (15.0% vs. 23.0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.20). Logistic regression analysis showed that bedside infectious disease consultation (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.69; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) was independently associated with lower in-hospital mortality.

All tests were performed in accordance with CLSI guidelines. All four ionophores demonstrated antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci at concentrations similar to those observed for methicillin-susceptible isolates of the same species. Testing of human and veterinary MRSA isolates also showed that MIC values were not influenced by the host origin of the isolates. Pharmacodynamic profiles were similar for both isolates tested across all four ionophores, with similar reductions in viable cell counts being observed over an 18- to 24-hr period.

To increase the specificity of roGFP2 for the interaction with the glutathione (GSH)/ glutathione disulfide (GSSG) redox couple, roGFP2 has been fused to glutaredoxin (Grx) to construct the Grx-roGFP2 biosensor. We have previously designed the related Brx-roGFP2 redox biosensor for dynamic measurement of the bacillithiol redox potential (<i>E</i><sub>BSH</sub>) in the human pathogen <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Here, we describe the detailed method for measurements of the oxidation degree (OxD) of the Brx-roGFP2 biosensor in <i>S. aureus</i> using the microplate reader. In particularly, we provide details for determination of the <i>E</i><sub>BSH</sub> changes during the growth and after oxidative stress. For future biosensor applications at the single cell level, we recommend the design of genome-encoded roGFP2 biosensors enabling stable expression and fluorescence in bacteria.\u2022Brx-roGFP2 is specific for measurements of the bacillithiol redox potential in <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> cells\u2022Control samples for fully reduced and oxidized states of Brx-roGFP2 are required for calibration during OxD measurements\u2022Easy to measure fluorescence excitation intensities at the 405 and 488 nm excitation maxima using microplate readers."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

The present study investigated the survival of five major foodborne pathogens on stainless steel coupons, in the presence of cooked rice, whole eggs, and soymilk. Foodborne pathogens showed different survival rates by desiccation and disinfection depending on food residues. Overall, the pathogens showed stronger survival than the control at 0.13-3.97 log CFU/coupon with 5% residues, and at 0.75-5.29 log CFU/coupon with 50% residues. <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> was not affected by the food residue with showing the least difference in concentration, while <i>Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7 showed the most significant increase by food residue. The cells with cooked rice were observed using FE-SEM, and demonstrated bacterial binding or embedment.

The cells of <i>L. innocua</i> and <i>E. coli</i> (as the most sensitive and resistant strains to the oil, respectively) treated with <i>C. zeylanicum</i> essential oil were observed by scanning electron microscopy to unravel structural changes. It was observed that the essential oil quickly exerted its antibacterial activity through disrupting cell envelope and facilitating the leakage of intracellular compounds. The essential oil had also a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect on adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs), and the cell proliferation could be induced by low concentrations of the oil.

The obtained results <i>in vitro</i> showed that the combination of the AMC with gentamicin did not induce a synergistic effect, whereas the combination of the two antibiotics with 1,8-cineole did. This effect is stronger when AMC is combined with 1,8-cineole as a total synergistic effect was obtained on the three strains used (FIC\u2009\u2264\u20090.5). <i>In vivo</i>, a significant reduction was noted in the number of colonies in the bone marrow when rabbits were treated with AMC associated with either 1,8-cineole or gentamicin compared to rabbits treated with AMC, gentamicin, or 1,8-cineole alone.

Staphylococcus aureus RN4220.", "Pagination": {"MedlinePgn": "e1057"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is resistant to most \u03b2-lactams due to the expression of an extra penicillin-binding protein, PBP2a, with low \u03b2-lactam affinity. It has long been known that heterologous expression of the PBP2a-encoding mecA gene in methicillin-sensitive S.\u00a0aureus (MSSA) provides protection towards \u03b2-lactams, however, some reports suggest that the degree of protection can vary between different \u03b2-lactams. To test this more systematically, we introduced an IPTG-inducible mecA into the MSSA laboratory strain RN4220. We confirm, by growth assays as well as single-cell microfluidics time-lapse microscopy experiments, that PBP2a expression protects against \u03b2-lactams in S.\u00a0aureus RN4220. By testing a panel of ten different \u03b2-lactams, we conclude that there is also a great variation in the level of protection conferred by PBP2a. Expression of PBP2a resulted in an only fourfold increase in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for imipenem, while a 32-fold increase in MIC was observed for cefaclor and cephalexin. Interestingly, in our experimental setup, PBP2a confers the highest protection against cefaclor and cephalexin-two \u03b2-lactams that are known to have a high specific affinity toward the transpeptidase PBP3 of S.\u00a0aureus. Notably, using a single-cell microfluidics setup we demonstrate a considerable phenotypic variation between cells upon \u03b2-lactam exposure and show that mecA-expressing S.\u00a0aureus can survive \u03b2-lactam concentrations much higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations. We discuss possible explanations and implications of these results including important aspects regarding treatment of infection."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 The Authors.

As all adaptive processes are underpinned by changes in gene expression, the RNAP can be considered the major mediator of any adaptive response in the bacterial cell. In bacterial pathogens, theoretically, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that encode subunits of the RNAP and associated factors could mediate adaptation and confer a selective advantage to cope with biotic and abiotic stresses. We investigated this possibility by undertaking a systematic survey of SNPs in genes encoding the RNAP and associated factors in a collection of 1,429 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates. We present evidence for the existence of several, hitherto unreported, nonsynonymous SNPs in genes encoding the RNAP and associated factors of MRSA ST22 clinical isolates and propose that the acquisition of amino acid substitutions in the RNAP could represent an adaptive strategy that contributes to the pathogenic success of MRSA."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 The Authors.

In contrast, fungal communities are richer and more diverse on the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis, although distribution of the most common species is similar in patients and controls. Filaggrin deficiency in atopic dermatitis skin might be related to the enhanced skin colonization by S. aureus. In addition, S. aureus expressing variant virulence factors have been shown to elicit atopic dermatitis-like phenotypes in mice, indicating that specific S. aureus strains can induce flare-ups.

The open reading frame of MnMOB1 consisted of 651 nucleotides that encoded 216 amino acid residues and contained the Mob1_phocein domain. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that MnMOB1 clustered together with the MOB1 from Penaeus vannamei. The distribution of MnMOB1 expression in various tissues of normal prawn revealed that the MnMOB1 expression was highest in the hepatopancreas followed by those in the intestines, gill, heart, stomach, and hemocytes. In prawns challenged with Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, the expression levels of MnMOB1 in the hepatopancreas, gills, and intestine were upregulated. Furthermore, the expression levels of crustins and anti-lipopolysaccharide factors in prawn injected with S. aureus and V. parahaemolyticus and MnMOB1 knockdown were significantly decreased relative to those in the control group.

The compounds were not only bactericidal against both replicating and stationary phase-persistent planktonic cells of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; they also killed biofilm-incorporated cells of both species while not affecting biofilm structural integrity. Moreover, these compounds were active against carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter sp. This simultaneous activity of compounds against different growth forms of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is rare. Genome sequencing of spontaneous resistant mutants and proteome analysis suggest that resistance is mediated by downregulation of the bacterial EIIBC phosphotransferase components scrA and mtlA in MRSA likely leading to a lower uptake of the molecules. Due to their only moderate cytotoxicity against human cell lines, phenoxyphenols provide an interesting new scaffold for development of antimicrobial agents with activity against planktonic cells, persisters and biofilm-incoporated cells of ESKAPE pathogens.

The mechanisms underlying these effects were also studied, and the minimum inhibitory concentration of RCP was determined for each species. Analyses of the levels of adenosine triphosphates (ATPases), including Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, and scanning electron microscopy confirmed that RCP damaged the microbial cell walls and membranes. RCP perturbed microbial metabolism and particularly affected the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), suggesting that this agent downregulated the levels of succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and ATPase activity in cells. Furthermore, RCP caused the leakage of genetic material from all four microbial strains. In conclusion, RCP effectively inhibited the growth of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and a fungal species by disrupting energy metabolic processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Qianjin Street 2699, Changchun, 130012, Jilin Province, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ruochen", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Qianjin Street 2699, Changchun, 130012, Jilin Province, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhai", "ForeName": "Siyu", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Qianjin Street 2699, Changchun, 130012, Jilin Province, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Yongtao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Qianjin Street 2699, Changchun, 130012, Jilin Province, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Teng", "ForeName": "Lirong", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Qianjin Street 2699, Changchun, 130012, Jilin Province, People's Republic of China. jluwangdi@jlu.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Di", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Qianjin Street 2699, Changchun, 130012, Jilin Province, People's Republic of China. zgr@jlu.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Guirong", "Initials": "G"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "SXGJXX2017-1", "Agency": "Jilin University and Jilin Province", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2019C050-8", "Agency": "Industrial Technology Research and Development Projects from Development and Reform Commission of Jilin Province", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mol Biol Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "0403234", "ISSNLinking": "0301-4851"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "01", "Day": "06"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "08"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["32415505", "10.1007/s11033-020-05508-1", "10.1007/s11033-020-05508-1"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [["Amino acid sequencing", "Antimicrobial", "Lectins", "Scanning electron microscopy"]], "PMID": "32415415", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "19"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "15"}], "ELocationID": ["10.1186/s13568-020-01024-4"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "2191-0855", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "10", "Issue": "1", "PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "May", "Day": "15"}}, "Title": "AMB Express", "ISOAbbreviation": "AMB Express"}, "ArticleTitle": "Characterization and antimicrobial activity of lectins purified from three Egyptian leguminous seeds.", "Pagination": {"MedlinePgn": "90"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that play vital roles in many biological processes. In this study, lectins from three Egyptian cultivars (fava bean, lentil, and pea) were isolated by precipitation with different concentrations of ammonium sulfate. The purification process was performed by affinity chromatography using mannose agarose. The highest concentration of purified lectins (1.48\u00a0mg/g) was recorded in pea at 90% saturation. SDS-PAGE of the purified lectins revealed bands of low molecular weights (14 to 18\u00a0kDa). The complete amino acid sequences of purified lectins were assessed using mass spectrometry (MS), which indicated the presence of the peptides favin, p54, and psl in fava bean, lentil, and pea, respectively. The lectins showed antimicrobial activity. The highest inhibition zone (35\u00a0mm) was measured with lectin purified from lentil against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, followed by pea lectin (33.4\u00a0mm) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145. To the best of our knowledge, the legume lectins in this study are the first lectins to exhibit antifungal activity against Candida albicans, with the maximum inhibition zone (25.1\u00a0mm) observed with purified lectins of fava bean. Additionally, the first scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showing agglutination and clumping of microbial cells exposed to tested lectins are provided. These findings proved that Egyptian legume lectins are distinct from other lectins reported in previous studies and demonstrated their potential as antimicrobial agents against human pathogenic microorganisms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botany, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "El-Araby", "ForeName": "Magda

Prior research demonstrated the potent quorum sensing inhibition effects of \"430D-F5\", a refined extract derived from the fruits of Schinus terebinthifolia, a medicinal plant used for the traditional treatment of skin and soft tissue infections. We report the isolation and identification of three compounds from 430D-F5 that reduce virulence and abate dermonecrosis: 3-oxo-olean-12-en-28-oic acid (1), 3-oxotirucalla-7,24Z-dien-26-oic acid (2) and 3\u03b1-hydroxytirucalla-7,24 Z-dien-27-oic acid (3). Each compound inhibits all S. aureus accessory gene regulator (agr) alleles (IC<sub>50</sub> 2-70\u2009\u03bcM). Dose-dependent responses were also observed in agr-regulated reporters for leucocidin A (lukA, IC<sub>50</sub> 0.4-25\u2009\u03bcM) and glycerol ester hydrolase or lipase (gehB, IC<sub>50</sub> 1.5-25\u2009\u03bcM). Surprisingly, dose-dependent activity against the nuclease reporter (nuc), which is under the control of the sae two-component system, was also observed (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.4-12.5\u2009\u03bcM). Compounds 1-3 exhibited little to no effect on the agr-independent mgrA P2 reporter (a constitutive promoter from the mgrA two-component system) and the esxA reporter (under control of mgrA). Compounds 1-3 inhibited \u03b4-toxin production in vitro and reduced dermonecrosis in a murine in vivo model.

We therefore sought to determine the metabolic pathways contributing to synthesis of essential precursors during invasive <i>S. aureus</i> infection. We focused specifically on staphylococcal infection of bone, one of the most common sites of invasive <i>S. aureus</i> infection and a unique environment characterized by dynamic substrate accessibility, infection-induced hypoxia, and a metabolic profile skewed toward aerobic glycolysis. Using a murine model of osteomyelitis, we examined survival of <i>S. aureus</i> mutants deficient in central metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and amino acid synthesis/catabolism. Despite the high glycolytic demand of skeletal cells, we discovered that <i>S. aureus</i> requires glycolysis for survival in bone. Furthermore, the TCA cycle is dispensable for survival during osteomyelitis, and <i>S. aureus</i> instead has a critical need for anaplerosis. Bacterial synthesis of aspartate in particular is absolutely essential for staphylococcal survival in bone, despite the presence of an aspartate transporter, which we identified as GltT and confirmed biochemically. This dependence on endogenous aspartate synthesis derives from the presence of excess glutamate in infected tissue, which inhibits aspartate acquisition by <i>S. aureus</i> Together, these data elucidate the metabolic pathways required for staphylococcal infection within bone and demonstrate that the host nutrient milieu can determine essentiality of bacterial nutrient biosynthesis pathways despite the presence of dedicated transporters."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 the Author(s).

In S. aureus, von Willebrand factor-binding protein (vWbp) is one of the key virulence determinants because it mediates not only the activation of thrombin to convert fibrinogen to fibrin, thereby enabling S. aureus to escape from the host immune clearance, but also the adhesion of S. aureus to host cells. Thus, vWbp is regarded as a promising druggable target to treat S. aureus-associated infections. Here we identify that baicalein, a natural compound isolated from the Chinese herb Scutellaria baicalensis, can effectively block the coagulase activity of vWbp without inhibiting the growth of the bacteria. Through thermal shift and fluorescence quenching assays, we demonstrated that baicalein directly binds to vWbp. Molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis assays revealed that the Asp-75 and Lys-80 residues are necessary for baicalein binding to vWbp. Importantly, we demonstrated that baicalein treatment attenuates the virulence of S. aureus and protects mice from S. aureus-induced lethal pneumonia. In addition, baicalein can improve the therapeutic effect of penicillin G by 75% in vivo. These findings indicate that baicalein might be developed as a promising therapeutic agent against drug-resistant S. aureus infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.

To combat IV infections, vaccines and antiviral compounds are available. However, vaccine efficacies vary with very limited to no protection against newly emerging zoonotic IV introductions. In addition, the development of resistant virus variants against currently available antivirals can be rapidly detected, in consequence demanding the design of novel antiviral strategies. Virus supportive cellular signaling cascades, such as the NF-\u03baB pathway, have been identified to be promising antiviral targets against IV in in vitro and in vivo studies and clinical trials. While administration of NF-\u03baB pathway inhibiting agents, such as LASAG results in decreased IV replication, it remained unclear whether blocking of NF-\u03baB might sensitize cells to secondary bacterial infections, which often come along with viral infections. Thus, we examined IV and Staphylococcus aureus growth during LASAG treatment. Interestingly, our data reveal that the presence of LASAG during superinfection still leads to reduced IV titers. Furthermore, the inhibition of the NF-\u03baB pathway resulted in decreased intracellular Staphylococcus aureus loads within epithelial cells, indicating a dependency on the pathway for bacterial uptake. Unfortunately, so far it is not entirely clear if this phenomenon might be a drawback in bacterial clearance during infection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation":

The dataset used was from a prospective open-label pharmacokinetic study of orally administered cephalexin in 12 children 1-16 years of age with bone and joint infections. Simulations were performed to determine a BID and TID dosing regimen so that \u226590% of children in this age group would achieve the pharmacodynamic target for MSSA (ie, time that the free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration of the bacteria for at least 40% of the dosing interval).", "The final model was 1 compartment with a transit compartment model to account for delay in oral absorption. For BID dosing, doses of 22-45 and 80\u2009mg/kg were required for MSSA with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1-2 and 4\u2009mg/L, respectively. For TID dosing, the respective required doses were 15-25 and 45\u2009mg/kg.", "Our study proposes a BID and TID cephalexin dosing regimen that can be prospectively evaluated. Through reducing the dose frequency of this widely prescribed antibiotic, we can reduce the medication burden for children and improve treatment compliance for MSSA infections."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the Department of Paediatrics, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of General Medicine, The Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infectious Diseases & Microbiology Group, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gwee", "ForeName": "Amanda", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Autmizguine", "ForeName": "Julie", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the Department of Paediatrics, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of General Medicine, The Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infectious Diseases & Microbiology Group, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Curtis", "ForeName": "Nigel", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duffull", "ForeName": "Stephen B", "Initials": "SB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pediatr Infect Dis J", "NlmUniqueID": "8701858", "ISSNLinking": "0891-3668"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32412727", "10.1097/INF.0000000000002646", "00006454-202006000-00012"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [["\nStryphnodendron adstringens\n", "antibacterial activity", "bioinformatics", "foodborne illness", "molecular modeling"]], "PMID": "32412089", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "06", "Day": "04"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "15"}], "ELocationID": ["10.1111/lam.13317"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1472-765X", "JournalIssue": {"PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "May", "Day": "15"}}, "Title": "Letters in applied microbiology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Lett.

We sought to combine 16S, metagenomics, and metabolomics data to describe multiple transitions between clinical disease states in 14 samples collected over a 12-month period in a single person with CF. We hypothesized that each clinical disease state would have a unique combination of bacterial genera and volatile metabolites as a potential signature that could be utilized as a biomarker of clinical disease state. Taxonomy identified by 16S sequencing corroborated clinical culture results, with the majority of the 109 PCR amplicons belonging to the bacteria grown in clinical cultures (<i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>). While alpha diversity measures fluctuated across disease states, no significant trends were present. Principle coordinates analysis showed that treatment samples trended toward a different community composition than baseline and exacerbation samples. This was driven by the phylum Bacteroidetes (less abundant in treatment, log<sub>2</sub> fold difference -3.29, <i>p</i> = 0.015) and the genus <i>Stenotrophomonas</i> (more abundant in treatment, log<sub>2</sub> fold difference 6.26, <i>p</i> = 0.003). Across all sputum samples, 466 distinct volatile metabolites were identified with total intensity varying across clinical disease state. Baseline and exacerbation samples were rather uniform in chemical composition and similar to one another, while treatment samples were highly variable and differed from the other two disease states. When utilizing a combination of the microbiome and metabolome data, we observed associations between samples dominated <i>Staphylococcus</i> and <i>Escherichia</i> and higher relative abundances of alcohols, while samples dominated by <i>Achromobacter</i> correlated with a metabolomics shift toward more oxidized volatiles. However, the microbiome and metabolome data were not tightly correlated; examining both the metagenomics and metabolomics allows for more context to examine changes across clinical disease states. In our study, combining the sputum microbiome and metabolome data revealed stability in the sputum composition through the first exacerbation and treatment episode, and into the second exacerbation. However, the second treatment ushered in a prolonged period of instability, which after three additional exacerbations and treatments culminated in a new lung microbiome and metabolome."],

Two of the most important pathogens to cause mastitis in dairy cattle are <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>S. aureus</i>) and <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>). While <i>S. aureus</i> generally induces a chronic and subclinical mastitis, <i>E. coli</i> is an important etiological pathogen resulting in an acute and clinical mastitis. The liver plays a central role in both, the metabolic and inflammatory physiology of the dairy cow, which is particularly challenged in the early lactation due to high metabolic and immunological demands. In the current study, we challenged the mammary glands of Holstein cows with <i>S. aureus</i> or <i>E. coli</i>, respectively, mimicking an early lactation infection. We compared the animals' liver transcriptomes with those of untreated controls to investigate the hepatic response of the individuals. Both, <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>E. coli</i> elicited systemic effects on the host after intramammary challenge and seemed to use pathogen-specific targeting strategies to bypass the innate immune system. The most striking result of our study is that we demonstrate for the first time that <i>S. aureus</i> intramammary challenge causes an immune response beyond the original local site of the mastitis. We found that in the peripheral liver tissue defined biological pathways are switched on in a coordinated manner to balance the immune response in the entire organism. TGFB1 signaling plays a crucial role in this context. Important pathways involving actin and integrin, key components of the cytoskeleton, were downregulated in the liver of <i>S. aureus</i> infected cows. In the hepatic transcriptome of <i>E. coli</i> infected cows, important components of the complement system were significantly lower expressed compared to the control cows. Notably, while <i>S. aureus</i> inhibits the cell signaling by Rho GTPases in the liver, <i>E. coli</i> switches the complement system off. Also, metabolic hepatic pathways (e.g., lipid metabolism) are affected after mammary gland challenge, demonstrating that the liver restricts metabolic tasks in favor of the predominant immune response after infection. Our results provide new insights for the infection-induced modifications of the dairy cow's hepatic transcriptome following mastitis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Heimes,

["<b>Background:</b> Despite improvements in management, infective endocarditis remains associated with high mortality and morbidity. We describe temporal changes in the incidence, microbiology and outcomes of infective endocarditis and the impact of changes in national antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines on incident infective endocarditis. <b>Methods:</b> Using a Scotland-wide, individual-level linkage approach, all patients hospitalized with infective endocarditis from 1990 until 2014 were identified and linked to national microbiology, prescribing and morbidity and mortality datasets. Linked data were used to evaluate trends in the crude and age- and sex-adjusted incidence and outcomes of infective endocarditis hospitalizations. From 2008, microbiology data and associated outcomes adjusted for patient demographics and comorbidity were also analyzed. An interrupted time series analysis was performed to evaluate incidence before and after changes to national antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines. <b>Results:</b> There were 7,638 hospitalizations (65\u00b117 years, 51% females) with infective endocarditis. The estimated crude hospitalization rate increased from 5.3/100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.8-5.9) to 8.6/100,000 (95% CI 8.1-9.1) between 1990 and 1995 but remained stable thereafter. There was no change in crude incidence following the 2008 change in antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines (relative risk of change 1.06, 95% CI 0.94-1.20). The incidence rate in patients >80 years doubled from 1990 to 2014 (17.7/100,000 [95% CI 13.4-23.3] to 37.9/100,000 [95% CI 31.5-45.5]). The predicted 1 year age- and comorbidity-adjusted case fatality rate for a 65 year-old patient decreased in women (27.3% [95% CI 24.6-30.2] to 23.7% [95% CI 21.1 to 26.6]) and men (30.7% [95% CI 27.7-33.8] to 26.8% [95% CI 24.0-29.7]) from 1990 to 2014. Blood culture data were available from 2008 (n=2,267/7,638, 30%), with positive blood cultures recorded in 42% (950/2,267). Staphylococcus (403/950, 42.4%) and streptococcus (337/950, 35.5%) species were most common. <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and enterococcus had the highest 1 year mortality (adjusted odds ratio 4.34 [95% CI 3.12-6.05] and 3.41 [95% CI 2.04-5.70], respectively). <b>Conclusions:</b> Despite changes in antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines, the crude incidence of infective endocarditis has remained stable. However, the incidence rate has doubled in the elderly. Positive blood cultures were observed in less than half of patients, with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and enterococcus bacteremia associated with worse outcomes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK; Usher Institute of Population Health Sciences and Informatics, University of Edinburgh, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Anoop S V", "Initials": "ASV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McAllister", "ForeName": "David A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gallacher", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Astengo", "ForeName": "Federica", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "P\u00e9rez", "ForeName": "Jes\u00fas Alberto Rodr\u00edguez", "Initials": "JAR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hall", "ForeName": "Jennifer", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Kuan Ken", "Initials": "KK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bing", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anand", "ForeName": "Atul", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academic Health Sciences Partnership in Tayside, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nathwani", "ForeName": "Dilip", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK; Usher Institute of Population Health Sciences and Informatics, University of Edinburgh, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mills", "ForeName": "Nicholas L", "Initials": "NL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Newby", "ForeName": "David E", "Initials": "DE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Population Health & Genomics, School of Medicine, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marwick", "ForeName": "Charis", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Edinburgh Heart Centre, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cruden", "ForeName": "Nicholas L", "Initials": "NL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Circulation", "NlmUniqueID": "0147763", "ISSNLinking": "0009-7322"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["32410460", "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044913"]}}]}, {"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"SpaceFlightMission": [], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherAbstract": [], "GeneralNote": [], "OtherID": [], "KeywordList": [], "PMID": "32410442", "DateRevised": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "06", "Day": "02"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "05", "Day": "20"}], "ELocationID": ["10.1021/acs.biochem.0c00213"], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1520-4995", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "59", "Issue": "21", "PubDate": {"Year": "2020", "Month": "Jun", "Day": "02"}}, "Title": "Biochemistry", "ISOAbbreviation": "Biochemistry"}, "ArticleTitle": "Dimeric Stilbene Antibiotics Target the Bacterial Cell Wall in Drug-Resistant Gram-Positive Pathogens.", "Pagination": {"MedlinePgn": "1966-1971"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["The prevalence of antibiotic resistance has been increasing globally, and new antimicrobial agents are needed to address this growing problem.

Here, we show that related dietary plant stilbene-derived dimers also have activity against these pathogens, and MRSA is unable to develop substantial resistance even after daily nonlethal exposure to the lead compound for a duration of three months. Through a systematic deduction process, we established the mode of action of the lead dimer, which targets the bacterial cell wall. Genome sequencing of modest resistance mutants, mass spectrometry analysis of cell wall precursors, and exogenous lipid II chemical complementation studies support the target as being lipid II itself or lipid II trafficking processes.

One of the common causes of chronic wounds is bacterial contamination that leads to persistent inflammation and unbalanced host cell immune responses. Among the bacterial strains that have been identified from chronic wounds, Staphylococcus aureus is the most common strain. We previously observed that S. aureus impaired mouse cutaneous wound healing by delaying re-epithelialization. Here, we investigated the mechanism of delayed re-epithelialization caused by S. aureus infection. With the presence of S. aureus exudate, the migration of in vitro cultured human keratinocytes was significantly inhibited and connexin-43 (Cx43) was upregulated. Inhibition of keratinocyte migration by S. aureus exudate disappeared in keratinocytes where the expression of Cx43 knocked down. Protein kinase phosphorylation array showed that phosphorylation of Akt-S473 was upregulated by S. aureus exudate. In vivo study of Cx43 in S. aureus-infected murine splinted cutaneous wound model showed upregulation of Cx43 in the migrating epithelial edge by S. aureus infection. Treatment with a PI3K/Akt inhibitor reduced Cx43 expression and overcame the wound closure impairment by S. aureus infection in the mouse model.

Advanced disease is invariably associated with severe immune dysregulation and the majority of patients die from infectious complications caused by microorganisms such as, Staphylococcus aureus, rather than from the lymphoma per se. Here, we examined if staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) may shape the phenotype of malignant SS cells, including expression of the regulatory T-cell-associated marker FOXP3. Our studies with primary and cultured malignant cells show that SE induce expression of FOXP3 in malignant cells when exposed to nonmalignant cells. Mutations in the MHC class II binding domain of SE-A (SEA) largely block the effect indicating that the response relies at least in part on the MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation. Transwell experiments show that the effect is induced by soluble factors, partly blocked by anti-IL-2 antibody, and depends on STAT5 activation in malignant cells. Collectively, these findings show that SE stimulate nonmalignant cells to induce FOXP3 expression in malignant cells. Thus, differences in exposure to environmental factors, such as bacterial toxins may explain the heterogeneous FOXP3 expression in malignant cells in SS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo":

Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are also well known for its antimicrobial properties. In this work, we prepared, characterized, evaluated the cytotoxicity and the antibacterial activity of alginate nanoparticles (alginate NPs) containing S-nitroso-mercaptosuccinic acid (S-nitroso-MSA, a NO donor) and/or AgNPs. AgNPs were obtained by plant mediated synthesis using green tea (Camellia sinensis), according to the green principles. Alginate NPs were obtained by ionotropic gelation with calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and used to incorporate the NO donor and/or AgNPs. The obtained nanoparticles containing S-nitroso-MSA and/or AgNPs have hydrodynamic size distribution in the range of 103.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9-414.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.6\u00a0nm with moderate polydispersity index and negative zeta potentials. Kinetic measurements showed a sustained NO release from alginate NPs, at the mili molar range. Both S-nitroso-MSA and AgNPs were able to diffuse from the nanoparticles following a Fickian diffusion mathematical model. The cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles was evaluated towards Vero cells, and a concentration dependent toxicity was observed. The combination of the NO donor and green tea AgNPs enhanced the toxicity to the tested cells. Finally, the antibacterial activity of the nanoparticles was demonstrated against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, and Streptococcus mutans UA159. Interestingly, the combination of the NO donor and AgNPs into alginate NPs had a superior antibacterial activity, compared with bacteria treated with alginate NPs containing S-nitroso-MSA or AgNPs individually. Moreover, antibacterial effects were observed at nanoparticle concentrations not toxic to Vero cell. To the best of knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate the ability of alginate NPs releasing NO and AgNPs with potent antimicrobial activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Discovery and development of new natural alternates with novel targets is utmost priority. In this experiment, alternative antibiotic agents in the form of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) and Achillea millefolium L. extracts were evaluated for antibacterial and antioxidant activity. The SNPs were synthesized using aqueous, ethanol and methanol extracts of A. millefolium and were monitored by a color change and UV-vis spectroscopy. The size and shape of the nanoparticles were determined through scanning electron microscopy and phase was assessed through X-ray diffraction. The SNPs were shown to have an average diameter of 20.77, 18.53 and 14.27\u00a0nm with spherical, rectangular and cubical shapes, synthesized from aqueous, ethanol and methanol extract respectively. The response of biomolecules present in plant extract during the formation of SNPs was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, showing polyphenols, proteins, carboxylic acid and alcohol are involved in the formation of SNPs. The plant extracts and SNPs were then studied for their antibacterial potential against common human pathogens such as gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), displaying a very good activity against both types of bacteria.
